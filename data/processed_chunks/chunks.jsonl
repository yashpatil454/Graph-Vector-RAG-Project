Different from these works, we focus on generative AI in the context of information systems, and, to this end, we discuss several opportunities and challenges that are unique to the BISE community and make suggestions for impactful directions for BISE research. 2 Conceptualization 2.1 Mathematical Principles of Generative AI Generative AI is primarily based on generative modeling, which has distinctive mathematical differences from dis- criminative modeling (Ng and Jordan 2001) often used in data-driven decision support. In general, discriminative modeling tries to separate data points X into different classes Y by learning decision boundaries between them (e.g., in classiﬁcation tasks with Y 2f 0; 1g). In contrast to that, generative modeling aims to infer some actual data distribution. Examples can be the joint probability distri- bution P(X, Y) of both the inputs and the outputs or P(Y), but where Y is typically from some high-dimensional space.

RLHF as used by ChatGPT proceeds in three steps to ﬁrst create demonstration data for prompts, then to have users rank the quality of different outputs for a prompt, and ﬁnally to learn a policy that generates desirable output via reinforcement learning so that the output would score well during ranking (Ziegler et al. 2019). 2.2.2 System-Level View Any system consists of a number of elements that are interconnected and", "metadata": {"producer": "Acrobat Distiller 10.1.8 (Windows)", "creator": "Springer", "creationdate": "2023-09-11T13:47:48+05:30", "author": "Stefan Feuerriegel", "crossmarkdomains[1]": "springer.com", "crossmarkdomains[2]": "springerlink.com", "crossmarkdomainexclusive": "true", "crossmarkmajorversiondate": "2010-04-23", "keywords": "Generative AI; Artificial intelligence; Decision support; Content creation; Information systems", "moddate": "2023-09-11T13:50:56+05:30", "subject": "Business & Information Systems Engineering, https://doi.org/10.1007/s12599-023-00834-7", "title": "Generative AI", "doi": "10.1007/s12599-023-00834-7", "robots": "noindex", "rgid": "PB:370653602_AS:11431281196092937@1696531787836", "source": "data\\aswqdd.pdf", "total_pages": 17, "page": 3, "page_label": "4", "start_index": 807}}

Formally, diffusion probability models capture the image data by modeling the way data points diffuse through a latent space, which is inspired by statistical physics. Speciﬁcally, they typically use Markov chains trained with variational inference and then reverse the diffusion process to generate a natural image.

With generative AI, a human uses prompts to engage with an AI system to create con- tent, and the AI then interprets the human’s intentions and provides feedback to presuppose further prompts. At ﬁrst glance, this seems to follow a delegation pattern as well. Yet, the subsequent process does not, as the output of the AI can be suggestive to the other and will inform their further involvement directly or subconsciously.

This skill is crucial for social interactions, as it facilitates empathy and allows for effective communication. Moreover, conferring a mind to an AI system can substantially drive usage intensity (Hartmann et al. 2023a). The development of a theory of mind in humans is unconscious and evolves throughout an individual’s life.

This includes developing and evaluating design principles for generative AI systems and applications to extend the limiting boundaries of this technology (cf. Section 3).

Generative AI has the potential to extract such design knowledge that is spread over a broad body of interdisciplinary research and make it available in a collective form for scholars and practitioners. This could also overcome the limitation that design knowledge is currently rarely reused, which ham- pers the fundamental idea of knowledge accumulation in design science research (Schoormann et al. 2021).

{"page_content": "2023). Different from these works, we focus on generative AI in the context of information systems, and, to this end, we discuss several opportunities and challenges that are unique to the BISE community and make suggestions for impactful directions for BISE research. 2 Conceptualization 2.1 Mathematical Principles of Generative AI Generative AI is primarily based on generative modeling, which has distinctive mathematical differences from dis- criminative modeling (Ng and Jordan 2001) often used in data-driven decision support. In general, discriminative modeling tries to separate data points X into different classes Y by learning decision boundaries between them (e.g., in classiﬁcation tasks with Y 2f 0; 1g). In contrast to that, generative modeling aims to infer some actual data distribution. Examples can be the joint probability distri- bution P(X, Y) of both the inputs and the outputs or P(Y), but where Y is typically from some high-dimensional space. By doing so, a generative", "metadata": {"producer": "Acrobat Distiller 10.1.8 (Windows)", "creator": "Springer", "creationdate": "2023-09-11T13:47:48+05:30", "author": "Stefan Feuerriegel", "crossmarkdomains[1]": "springer.com", "crossmarkdomains[2]": "springerlink.com", "crossmarkdomainexclusive": "true", "crossmarkmajorversiondate": "2010-04-23", "keywords": "Generative AI; Artificial intelligence; Decision support; Content creation; Information systems", "moddate": "2023-09-11T13:50:56+05:30", "subject": "Business & Information Systems Engineering, https://doi.org/10.1007/s12599-023-00834-7", "title": "Generative AI", "doi": "10.1007/s12599-023-00834-7", "robots": "noindex", "rgid": "PB:370653602_AS:11431281196092937@1696531787836", "source": "data\\bgbtrbvrtbvr.pdf", "total_pages": 17, "page": 2, "page_label": "3", "start_index": 0}}

By doing so, a generative model offers the ability to produce new synthetic samples (e.g., generate new obser- vation-target-pairs ( X, Y) or new observations X given a target value Y) (Bishop 2006). Building upon the above, a generative AI model refers to generative modeling that is instantiated with a machine learning architecture (e.g., a deep neural network) and, therefore, can create new data samples based on learned patterns. 1 Further, a generative AI system encompasses the entire infrastructure, including the model, data processing, and user interface components.

Recent advances allow for more complex data-driven prompt engineering, such as tuning prompts via reinforcement learning (Liu et al. 2023). seq2seq The term sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) refers to machine learning approaches where an input sequence is mapped onto an output sequence (Sutskever et al. 2014). An example is machine learning-based translation between different languages.

The idea of seq2seq models has been extended to allow for multi-modal mappings such as text-to-image or text-to-speech mappings. Transformer A transformer is a deep learning architecture (Vaswani et al. 2017) that adopts the mechanism of self- attention which differentially weights the importance of each part of the input data.

A theory of the artiﬁcial mind that explains how individuals perceive and assume the states and rationale of AI systems to better collaborate with them may alleviate some of these concerns. 3 Limitations of Current Generative AI In the following, we discuss four salient boundaries of generative AI that, we argue, are important limitations in real-world applications.

This is owed to the underlying nature of machine learning models relying on probabilistic algo- rithms for making inferences. For example, generative AI models generate the most probable response to a prompt, not necessarily the correct response. As such, challenges arise as, by now, outputs are indistinguishable from authentic content and may present misinformation or deceive users (Spitale et al. 2023).

Moreover, the output of generative AI, especially that of LLMs, is typically not easily veriﬁable. The correctness of generative AI models is highly dependent on the quality of training data and the according learning process. Generative AI systems and applications can implement correctness checks to inhibit certain out- puts.

Bias and fairness. Societal biases permeate everyday human-generated content (Eskreis-Winkler and Fishbach 2022). The unbiasedness of vanilla generative AI is very much dependent on the quality of training data and the alignment process.

Human biases can also creep into the models in other stages of the model engineering process. For instruction- based language models, the RLHF process is an additional source of bias (OpenAI 2023b). Careful coding guidelines and quality checks can help address these risks.

For a long time in history, it has been the prevailing assumption that artistic, creative tasks such as writing poems, creating software, designing fashion, and compos- ing songs could only be performed by humans. This assumption has changed drastically with recent advances in artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) that can generate new content in ways that cannot be distinguished anymore from human craftsmanship.

The term generative AI refers to computational tech- niques that are capable of generating seemingly new, meaningful content such as text, images, or audio from training data. The widespread diffusion of this technology with examples such as Dall-E 2, GPT-4, and Copilot is currently revolutionizing the way we work and communi- cate with each other. Generative AI systems can not only be used for artistic purposes to create new text mimicking writers or new images mimicking illustrators, but they can and will assist humans as intelligent question-answering systems. Here, applications include information technology (IT) help desks where generative AI supports transitional knowledge work tasks and mundane needs such as cooking recipes and medical advice.

Undoubtedly, this has drastic implications not only for the Business & Informa- tion Systems Engineering (BISE) community, where we will face revolutionary opportunities, but also challenges and risks that we need to tackle and manage to steer the technology and its use in a responsible and sustainable direction. In this Catchword article, we provide a conceptualiza- tion of generative AI as an entity in socio-technical systems and provide examples of models, systems, and applica- tions. Based on that, we introduce limitations of current generative AI and provide an agenda for BISE research.

Different from these works, we focus on generative AI in the context of information systems, and, to this end, we discuss several opportunities and challenges that are unique to the BISE community and make suggestions for impactful directions for BISE research. 2 Conceptualization 2.1 Mathematical Principles of Generative AI Generative AI is primarily based on generative modeling, which has distinctive mathematical differences from dis- criminative modeling (Ng and Jordan 2001) often used in data-driven decision support. In general, discriminative modeling tries to separate data points X into different classes Y by learning decision boundaries between them (e.g., in classiﬁcation tasks with Y 2f 0; 1g). In contrast to that, generative modeling aims to infer some actual data distribution. Examples can be the joint probability distri- bution P(X, Y) of both the inputs and the outputs or P(Y), but where Y is typically from some high-dimensional space.

Multimodal models exist across a variety of data modalities, for example for text, image, and audio.

Thanks to the adversarial learning objective, the generator learns to map from a latent space to a data distribution of interest, while the discriminator distinguishes candidates produced by the generator from the true data distribution (see Fig. 2).

Bias and fairness. Societal biases permeate everyday human-generated content (Eskreis-Winkler and Fishbach 2022).

{"page_content": "when constructing novel IT artifacts (see Hevner et al. 2019). Here, one of the biggest potentials could lie in the support of knowledge retrieval tasks. Currently, design knowledge in the form of design requirements, design principles, and design features is often only available in encapsulated written papers or implicitly embedded in instantiated artifacts. Generative AI has the potential to extract such design knowledge that is spread over a broad body of interdisciplinary research and make it available in a collective form for scholars and practitioners. This could also overcome the limitation that design knowledge is currently rarely reused, which ham- pers the fundamental idea of knowledge accumulation in design science research (Schoormann et al. 2021). Besides engineering actual systems and applications, the BISE community should also investigate how generative AI can be used to support creativity-based tasks when 123 S.

In this regard, a promising direction could be to incorporate generative AI in design thinking and similar methodologies to combine human creativity with computational creativity (Hawlitschek 2023). This may support different phases and steps of innovation projects, such as idea generation, user needs elicitation, prototyping, design evaluation, and design automation, in which different types of generative AI models and systems could be used and combined with each other to form applications for creative industries (e.g., generated user stories with textual descriptions, visual mock-ups for user interfaces, and quick software proto- types for proofs-of-concept). If generative AI is used to co- create innovative outcomes, it may also enable better reﬂection of the different design activities to ensure the necessary learning (Schoormann et al. 2023a). 5 Conclusion Generative AI is a branch of AI that can create new content such as texts, images, or audio", "metadata": {"producer": "Acrobat Distiller 10.1.8 (Windows)", "creator": "Springer", "creationdate": "2023-09-11T13:47:48+05:30", "author": "Stefan Feuerriegel", "crossmarkdomains[1]": "springer.com", "crossmarkdomains[2]": "springerlink.com", "crossmarkdomainexclusive": "true", "crossmarkmajorversiondate": "2010-04-23", "keywords": "Generative AI; Artificial intelligence; Decision support; Content creation; Information systems", "moddate": "2023-09-11T13:50:56+05:30", "subject": "Business & Information Systems Engineering, https://doi.org/10.1007/s12599-023-00834-7", "title": "Generative AI", "doi": "10.1007/s12599-023-00834-7", "robots": "noindex", "rgid": "PB:370653602_AS:11431281196092937@1696531787836", "source": "data\\dwqdwqdqd.pdf", "total_pages": 17, "page": 13, "page_label": "14", "start_index": 0}}

For this reason, generative AI has the potential to transform domains and industries that rely on creativity, innovation, and knowledge processing. In particular, it enables new applications that were previously impossible or impractical for automation, such as realistic virtual assistants, personalized education and service, and digital art. As such, generative AI has substantial implications for BISE practitioners and scholars as an interdisciplinary research community.

Different from these works, we focus on generative AI in the context of information systems, and, to this end, we discuss several opportunities and challenges that are unique to the BISE community and make suggestions for impactful directions for BISE research. 2 Conceptualization 2.1 Mathematical Principles of Generative AI Generative AI is primarily based on generative modeling, which has distinctive mathematical differences from dis- criminative modeling (Ng and Jordan 2001) often used in data-driven decision support. In general, discriminative modeling tries to separate data points X into different classes Y by learning decision boundaries between them (e.g., in classiﬁcation tasks with Y 2f 0; 1g). In contrast to that, generative modeling aims to infer some actual data distribution. Examples can be the joint probability distri- bution P(X, Y) of both the inputs and the outputs or P(Y), but where Y is typically from some high-dimensional space.

Differently, systems such as ChatGPT- based conversational models use reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). RLHF as used by ChatGPT proceeds in three steps to ﬁrst create demonstration data for prompts, then to have users rank the quality of different outputs for a prompt, and ﬁnally to learn a policy that generates desirable output via reinforcement learning so that the output would score well during ranking (Ziegler et al. 2019). 2.2.2 System-Level View Any system consists of a number of elements that are interconnected and", "metadata": {"producer": "Acrobat Distiller 10.1.8 (Windows)", "creator": "Springer", "creationdate": "2023-09-11T13:47:48+05:30", "author": "Stefan Feuerriegel", "crossmarkdomains[1]": "springer.com", "crossmarkdomains[2]": "springerlink.com", "crossmarkdomainexclusive": "true", "crossmarkmajorversiondate": "2010-04-23", "keywords": "Generative AI; Artificial intelligence; Decision support; Content creation; Information systems", "moddate": "2023-09-11T13:50:56+05:30", "subject": "Business & Information Systems Engineering, https://doi.org/10.1007/s12599-023-00834-7", "title": "Generative AI", "doi": "10.1007/s12599-023-00834-7", "robots": "noindex", "rgid": "PB:370653602_AS:11431281196092937@1696531787836", "source": "data\\dqwsadsfef.pdf", "total_pages": 17, "page": 3, "page_label": "4", "start_index": 807}}

Speciﬁcally, they typically use Markov chains trained with variational inference and then reverse the diffusion process to generate a natural image.

With generative AI, a human uses prompts to engage with an AI system to create con- tent, and the AI then interprets the human’s intentions and provides feedback to presuppose further prompts. At ﬁrst glance, this seems to follow a delegation pattern as well. Yet, the subsequent process does not, as the output of the AI can be suggestive to the other and will inform their further involvement directly or subconsciously.

This skill is crucial for social interactions, as it facilitates empathy and allows for effective communication. Moreover, conferring a mind to an AI system can substantially drive usage intensity (Hartmann et al. 2023a).

This includes developing and evaluating design principles for generative AI systems and applications to extend the limiting boundaries of this technology (cf. Section 3).

Generative AI has the potential to extract such design knowledge that is spread over a broad body of interdisciplinary research and make it available in a collective form for scholars and practitioners. This could also overcome the limitation that design knowledge is currently rarely reused, which ham- pers the fundamental idea of knowledge accumulation in design science research (Schoormann et al. 2021).

Additionally, models such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and fully convolutional networks (FCNs) are commonly used in its architecture. Generative AI, on the other hand, takes inputs such as text and produces outputs such as text or images using a generation model. A defining feature of Generative AI is its ability to generate high-information outputs, such as long text or images, from relatively low-information inputs, such as short sentences.

A common way to interact with Generative AI is by pro- viding instructions in the form of text, leading to the wide- spread use of the term “prompt” to describe the input given to Generative AI. In the past, due to AI’s limited capabili- ties, it was seen as merely a machine that followed human instructions. However, with recent advancements in AI performance, Generative AI is increasingly perceived as an entity capable of intelligent reasoning, which has led to the adoption of the term “prompt,” like how humans give instructions to one another.

VAEs offer stable training and make it easier to evaluate training progress, but they strug- gle to create highly expressive models. On the other hand, GANs can generate highly detailed images, as seen in StyleGAN2 [5], which has demonstrated impressive facial image generation. However, GANs suffer from unstable training and difficulty in evaluating training progress.

This chapter discusses the mechanism of diffusion mod- els and their applications in medical image processing. 3.2 Diffusion models This section provides a brief explanation of diffusion models. Diffusion models are inspired by thermodynam- ics, where the concentration of substances, temperature, and energy differences tend to equalize over time. This phenomenon occurs because molecules within a substance undergo random motion due to thermal energy, gradually mixing until they achieve a uniform distribution. The dif- fusion probabilistic model (DPM) [6 ], which forms the foundation of diffusion models, was developed based on this diffusion process. In DPM, noise is gradually added to the data distribution, transforming it into a completely noisy distribution (diffusion process).

Please note that the assumption of the existence of reverse transformations of the diffusion process in DPM is different from the diffusion process in thermodynamics. For image generation, a commonly used variant of DPM is the denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) [7 ]. In DDPM, an image undergoes a diffusion process, where gradual noise is added until the image is completely trans - formed into pure noise. Then, through the reverse diffusion process, the model progressively removes the noise to recon- struct an image.

The U-Net is an encoder–decoder style FCN model, which is commonly used to perform medical image segmentation. This model takes a noisy image as input and outputs an image with slightly reduced noise. The final generated image is obtained by repeatedly applying this noise reduction process. Since the deep learning model needs to reduce noise at each iteration appropriately, it receives both the step count and generation conditions as input.

The core tasks in NLP include text classification and generation, and research has been conducted to enhance these capabilities. Some practical applications of NLP include machine translation, kana–kanji conversion, search engines, and dialogue systems, many of which had already been studied and commercially applied even before Chat- GPT emerged. Similar to image processing, NLP models have increas- ingly adopted deep learning techniques. To handle sequen- tial data such as text, early models relied on recurrent neu- ral networks (RNNs) and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks [ 22], which improved RNNs’ ability to process long sequences.

{"page_content": "CATCHWORD Generative AI Stefan Feuerriegel • Jochen Hartmann • Christian Janiesch • Patrick Zschech Received: 29 April 2023 / Accepted: 7 August 2023 /C211The Author(s) 2023 Keywords Generative AI /C1 Artiﬁcial intelligence /C1 Decision support /C1 Content creation /C1 Information systems 1 Introduction Tom Freston is credited with saying ‘‘Innovation is taking two things that exist and putting them together in a new way’’.

Different from these works, we focus on generative AI in the context of information systems, and, to this end, we discuss several opportunities and challenges that are unique to the BISE community and make suggestions for impactful directions for BISE research. 2 Conceptualization 2.1 Mathematical Principles of Generative AI Generative AI is primarily based on generative modeling, which has distinctive mathematical differences from dis- criminative modeling (Ng and Jordan 2001) often used in data-driven decision support. In general, discriminative modeling tries to separate data points X into different classes Y by learning decision boundaries between them (e.g., in classiﬁcation tasks with Y 2f 0; 1g). In contrast to that, generative modeling aims to infer some actual data distribution. Examples can be the joint probability distri- bution P(X, Y) of both the inputs and the outputs or P(Y), but where Y is typically from some high-dimensional space.

Multimodal models exist across a variety of data modalities, for example for text, image, and audio.

Formally, diffusion probability models capture the image data by modeling the way data points diffuse through a latent space, which is inspired by statistical physics. Speciﬁcally, they typically use Markov chains trained with variational inference and then reverse the diffusion process to generate a natural image. A notable variant is Stable Diffusion (Rombach et al. 2022). Diffusion probability models are also used in commercial systems such as DALL-E and Midjourney.

With generative AI, a human uses prompts to engage with an AI system to create con- tent, and the AI then interprets the human’s intentions and provides feedback to presuppose further prompts.

This skill is crucial for social interactions, as it facilitates empathy and allows for effective communication. Moreover, conferring a mind to an AI system can substantially drive usage intensity (Hartmann et al. 2023a). The development of a theory of mind in humans is unconscious and evolves throughout an individual’s life.

To this end, legal questions arise around the balance of originality and cre- ativity in generative AI systems. Along these lines, legal questions also arise around who holds the intellectual property for works (including patents) produced by a generative AI. Environmental concerns.

This includes developing and evaluating design principles for generative AI systems and applications to extend the limiting boundaries of this technology (cf. Section 3).

Currently, design knowledge in the form of design requirements, design principles, and design features is often only available in encapsulated written papers or implicitly embedded in instantiated artifacts. Generative AI has the potential to extract such design knowledge that is spread over a broad body of interdisciplinary research and make it available in a collective form for scholars and practitioners. This could also overcome the limitation that design knowledge is currently rarely reused, which ham- pers the fundamental idea of knowledge accumulation in design science research (Schoormann et al. 2021).

Different from these works, we focus on generative AI in the context of information systems, and, to this end, we discuss several opportunities and challenges that are unique to the BISE community and make suggestions for impactful directions for BISE research. 2 Conceptualization 2.1 Mathematical Principles of Generative AI Generative AI is primarily based on generative modeling, which has distinctive mathematical differences from dis- criminative modeling (Ng and Jordan 2001) often used in data-driven decision support. In general, discriminative modeling tries to separate data points X into different classes Y by learning decision boundaries between them (e.g., in classiﬁcation tasks with Y 2f 0; 1g). In contrast to that, generative modeling aims to infer some actual data distribution. Examples can be the joint probability distri- bution P(X, Y) of both the inputs and the outputs or P(Y), but where Y is typically from some high-dimensional space.

By doing so, a generative model offers the ability to produce new synthetic samples (e.g., generate new obser- vation-target-pairs ( X, Y) or new observations X given a target value Y) (Bishop 2006). Building upon the above, a generative AI model refers to generative modeling that is instantiated with a machine learning architecture (e.g., a deep neural network) and, therefore, can create new data samples based on learned patterns. 1 Further, a generative AI system encompasses the entire infrastructure, including the model, data processing, and user interface components.

Similarly, ChatGPT combines techniques from generative modeling together with discriminatory modeling and reinforcement learning (see Fig. 2). 123 S.

Speciﬁcally, they typically use Markov chains trained with variational inference and then reverse the diffusion process to generate a natural image.

Zero-shot learning is when a machine is taught how to learn a task from data without ever needing to access the data itself, while few-short learning refers to when there are only a few speciﬁc examples. Zero-shot learning and few-shot learning are often desirable in practice as they reduce the cost of setting up AI systems. LLMs are few-shot or zero-shot learners (Brown et al. 2020) as they just need a few samples to learn a task (e.g., predicting the sentiment of reviews), which makes LLMs highly ﬂexible as a general-purpose tool.

Recent studies expose the harmful biases embedded in multimodal generative AI models such as CLIP (contrastive language-image pre- training; Wolfe et al. 2022) and the CLIP-ﬁltered LAION dataset (Birhane et al. 2021), which are core components of generative AI models (e.g., Dall-E 2 or Stable Diffu- sion). Human biases can also creep into the models in other stages of the model engineering process. For instruction- based language models, the RLHF process is an additional source of bias (OpenAI 2023b). Careful coding guidelines and quality checks can help address these risks.

{"page_content": "2023). Different from these works, we focus on generative AI in the context of information systems, and, to this end, we discuss several opportunities and challenges that are unique to the BISE community and make suggestions for impactful directions for BISE research. 2 Conceptualization 2.1 Mathematical Principles of Generative AI Generative AI is primarily based on generative modeling, which has distinctive mathematical differences from dis- criminative modeling (Ng and Jordan 2001) often used in data-driven decision support. In general, discriminative modeling tries to separate data points X into different classes Y by learning decision boundaries between them (e.g., in classiﬁcation tasks with Y 2f 0; 1g). In contrast to that, generative modeling aims to infer some actual data distribution. Examples can be the joint probability distri- bution P(X, Y) of both the inputs and the outputs or P(Y), but where Y is typically from some high-dimensional space. By doing so, a generative", "metadata": {"producer": "Acrobat Distiller 10.1.8 (Windows)", "creator": "Springer", "creationdate": "2023-09-11T13:47:48+05:30", "author": "Stefan Feuerriegel", "crossmarkdomains[1]": "springer.com", "crossmarkdomains[2]": "springerlink.com", "crossmarkdomainexclusive": "true", "crossmarkmajorversiondate": "2010-04-23", "keywords": "Generative AI; Artificial intelligence; Decision support; Content creation; Information systems", "moddate": "2023-09-11T13:50:56+05:30", "subject": "Business & Information Systems Engineering, https://doi.org/10.1007/s12599-023-00834-7", "title": "Generative AI", "doi": "10.1007/s12599-023-00834-7", "robots": "noindex", "rgid": "PB:370653602_AS:11431281196092937@1696531787836", "source": "data\\regsfsd.pdf", "total_pages": 17, "page": 2, "page_label": "3", "start_index": 0}}
{"page_content": "Examples can be the joint probability distri- bution P(X, Y) of both the inputs and the outputs or P(Y), but where Y is typically from some high-dimensional space. By doing so, a generative model offers the ability to produce new synthetic samples (e.g., generate new obser- vation-target-pairs ( X, Y) or new observations X given a target value Y) (Bishop 2006).

Research is already investigating how AI systems can become theory-of-mind-aware to better understand their human counterpart (Rabinowitz et al. 2018;C¸ elikok et al. 2019).

A theory of the artiﬁcial mind that explains how individuals perceive and assume the states and rationale of AI systems to better collaborate with them may alleviate some of these concerns. 3 Limitations of Current Generative AI In the following, we discuss four salient boundaries of generative AI that, we argue, are important limitations in real-world applications.

This is owed to the underlying nature of machine learning models relying on probabilistic algo- rithms for making inferences. For example, generative AI models generate the most probable response to a prompt, not necessarily the correct response. As such, challenges arise as, by now, outputs are indistinguishable from authentic content and may present misinformation or deceive users (Spitale et al. 2023).

Moreover, the output of generative AI, especially that of LLMs, is typically not easily veriﬁable. The correctness of generative AI models is highly dependent on the quality of training data and the according learning process.

Bias and fairness. Societal biases permeate everyday human-generated content (Eskreis-Winkler and Fishbach 2022). The unbiasedness of vanilla generative AI is very much dependent on the quality of training data and the alignment process.

This will be crucial in practice to solve speciﬁc BISE-related tasks where cus- tomization may bring additional performance gains. Novel techniques for customization must be designed in a way that ensures the safety of proprietary data and prevents the data from being disclosed.

Another important research direction is to improve the reliability of generative AI systems. For example, algo- rithmic solutions are needed on how generative AI can detect and mitigate hallucination. In addition to algorithmic solutions, more effort is also needed to develop user-cen- tered solutions, that is, how users can reduce the risk of falling for incorrect outcomes, for example, by developing better ways how outputs can be veriﬁed (e.g., by offering additional explanations or references).

As such, generative AI has substantial implications for BISE practitioners and scholars as an interdisciplinary research community.

For a long time in history, it has been the prevailing assumption that artistic, creative tasks such as writing poems, creating software, designing fashion, and compos- ing songs could only be performed by humans. This assumption has changed drastically with recent advances in artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) that can generate new content in ways that cannot be distinguished anymore from human craftsmanship.

The term generative AI refers to computational tech- niques that are capable of generating seemingly new, meaningful content such as text, images, or audio from training data. The widespread diffusion of this technology with examples such as Dall-E 2, GPT-4, and Copilot is currently revolutionizing the way we work and communi- cate with each other. Generative AI systems can not only be used for artistic purposes to create new text mimicking writers or new images mimicking illustrators, but they can and will assist humans as intelligent question-answering systems. Here, applications include information technology (IT) help desks where generative AI supports transitional knowledge work tasks and mundane needs such as cooking recipes and medical advice.

{"page_content": "Industry reports suggest that generative AI could raise global gross domestic product (GDP) by 7% and replace 300 million jobs of knowledge workers (Goldman Sachs 2023). Undoubtedly, this has drastic implications not only for the Business & Informa- tion Systems Engineering (BISE) community, where we will face revolutionary opportunities, but also challenges and risks that we need to tackle and manage to steer the technology and its use in a responsible and sustainable direction.

Different from these works, we focus on generative AI in the context of information systems, and, to this end, we discuss several opportunities and challenges that are unique to the BISE community and make suggestions for impactful directions for BISE research. 2 Conceptualization 2.1 Mathematical Principles of Generative AI Generative AI is primarily based on generative modeling, which has distinctive mathematical differences from dis- criminative modeling (Ng and Jordan 2001) often used in data-driven decision support. In general, discriminative modeling tries to separate data points X into different classes Y by learning decision boundaries between them (e.g., in classiﬁcation tasks with Y 2f 0; 1g). In contrast to that, generative modeling aims to infer some actual data distribution. Examples can be the joint probability distri- bution P(X, Y) of both the inputs and the outputs or P(Y), but where Y is typically from some high-dimensional space.

Building upon the above, a generative AI model refers to generative modeling that is instantiated with a machine learning architecture (e.g., a deep neural network) and, therefore, can create new data samples based on learned patterns. 1 Further, a generative AI system encompasses the entire infrastructure, including the model, data processing, and user interface components.

{"page_content": "Midjourney accepts both modalities to generate images. To this end, generative AI models can also be grouped into unimodal and multimodal models. Unimodal models take instructions from the same input type as their output (e.g., text). On the other hand, multimodal models can take input from different sources and generate output in various forms. Multimodal models exist across a variety of data modalities, for example for text, image, and audio. Prominent examples include Stable Diffusion (Rombach et al. 2022) for text-to-image generation, MusicLM (Agostinelli et al. 2023) for text-to-music generation, Codex (Chen et al. 2021) and AlphaCode (Li et al. 2022) for text-to-code generation, and as mentioned above GPT-4 for image-to-text as well as text-to-text generation (OpenAI 2023a).

{"page_content": "Table 1 Glossary of key concepts in generative AI Concept Description Diffusion probabilistic models Diffusion probability models are a class of latent variable models that are common for various tasks such as image generation (Ho et al. 2020). Formally, diffusion probability models capture the image data by modeling the way data points diffuse through a latent space, which is inspired by statistical physics. Speciﬁcally, they typically use Markov chains trained with variational inference and then reverse the diffusion process to generate a natural image. A notable variant is Stable Diffusion (Rombach et al. 2022). Diffusion probability models are also used in commercial systems such as DALL-E and Midjourney. Generative adversarial network A GAN is a class of neural network architecture with a custom, adversarial learning objective (Goodfellow et al. 2014).

The second network D is called the discriminator, which evaluates how likely the candidate samples come from a desired distribution. Thanks to the adversarial learning objective, the generator learns to map from a latent space to a data distribution of interest, while the discriminator distinguishes candidates produced by the generator from the true data distribution (see Fig. 2).

With the advent of agentic IT artifacts (Baird and Maruping 2021) powered by LLMs (Park et al. 2023), this human agency primacy assumption needs to be revisited and impacts how we devise the relation between human and AI based on their potency.

Focusing on the interaction between humans and AI, so far, for analytic AI, the concept of delegation has been discussed to establish a hierarchy for decision-making (Baird and Maruping 2021). With generative AI, a human uses prompts to engage with an AI system to create con- tent, and the AI then interprets the human’s intentions and provides feedback to presuppose further prompts. At ﬁrst glance, this seems to follow a delegation pattern as well. Yet, the subsequent process does not, as the output of the AI can be suggestive to the other and will inform their further involvement directly or subconsciously.

This skill is crucial for social interactions, as it facilitates empathy and allows for effective communication. Moreover, conferring a mind to an AI system can substantially drive usage intensity (Hartmann et al. 2023a). The development of a theory of mind in humans is unconscious and evolves throughout an individual’s life. The more natural AI systems become in terms of their interface and output, the more a theory of mind for human-computer interactions becomes necessary.

This is owed to the underlying nature of machine learning models relying on probabilistic algo- rithms for making inferences. For example, generative AI models generate the most probable response to a prompt, not necessarily the correct response. As such, challenges arise as, by now, outputs are indistinguishable from authentic content and may present misinformation or deceive users (Spitale et al. 2023).

This includes developing and evaluating design principles for generative AI systems and applications to extend the limiting boundaries of this technology (cf. Section 3).

Generative AI has the potential to extract such design knowledge that is spread over a broad body of interdisciplinary research and make it available in a collective form for scholars and practitioners. This could also overcome the limitation that design knowledge is currently rarely reused, which ham- pers the fundamental idea of knowledge accumulation in design science research (Schoormann et al. 2021).

Diffusion models are inspired by thermodynam- ics, where the concentration of substances, temperature, and energy differences tend to equalize over time. This phenomenon occurs because molecules within a substance undergo random motion due to thermal energy, gradually mixing until they achieve a uniform distribution. The dif- fusion probabilistic model (DPM) [6 ], which forms the foundation of diffusion models, was developed based on this diffusion process. In DPM, noise is gradually added to the data distribution, transforming it into a completely noisy distribution (diffusion process).

Please note that the assumption of the existence of reverse transformations of the diffusion process in DPM is different from the diffusion process in thermodynamics. For image generation, a commonly used variant of DPM is the denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) [7 ]. In DDPM, an image undergoes a diffusion process, where gradual noise is added until the image is completely trans - formed into pure noise. Then, through the reverse diffusion process, the model progressively removes the noise to recon- struct an image. Since this reverse diffusion process creates an image, it is also called the generation process.

The U-Net is an encoder–decoder style FCN model, which is commonly used to perform medical image segmentation. This model takes a noisy image as input and outputs an image with slightly reduced noise. The final generated image is obtained by repeatedly applying this noise reduction process. Since the deep learning model needs to reduce noise at each iteration appropriately, it receives both the step count and generation conditions as input. The reverse diffusion process typically involves about 1000 steps to generate high-quality images. In image generation, text or other images are often used to control the output.

In this method, a sentence is converted into a fill-in-the-blank problem.

In foundation model develop- ment, self-supervised learning (SSL) is typically used for pretraining, using many unlabeled images [40]. After pre- training, transfer learning or fine-tuning is performed using labeled images for the target downstream task, resulting in a task-specific model.

To overcome this, researchers can leverage supercomputers developed by universities and research institutions. Considering the growing demands of AI devel- opment, many of these supercomputers are equipped with many GPUs and support general development environments, including Python. With access to such infrastructure, it is entirely feasible to develop large-scale AI models. Although using supercomputers typically incurs usage fees, several support programs are available to subsidize these costs. When effectively utilized, these programs can allow access to powerful computational resources with little to no finan- cial burden.

{"page_content": "2023). Different from these works, we focus on generative AI in the context of information systems, and, to this end, we discuss several opportunities and challenges that are unique to the BISE community and make suggestions for impactful directions for BISE research. 2 Conceptualization 2.1 Mathematical Principles of Generative AI Generative AI is primarily based on generative modeling, which has distinctive mathematical differences from dis- criminative modeling (Ng and Jordan 2001) often used in data-driven decision support. In general, discriminative modeling tries to separate data points X into different classes Y by learning decision boundaries between them (e.g., in classiﬁcation tasks with Y 2f 0; 1g). In contrast to that, generative modeling aims to infer some actual data distribution. Examples can be the joint probability distri- bution P(X, Y) of both the inputs and the outputs or P(Y), but where Y is typically from some high-dimensional space. By doing so, a generative", "metadata": {"producer": "Acrobat Distiller 10.1.8 (Windows)", "creator": "Springer", "creationdate": "2023-09-11T13:47:48+05:30", "author": "Stefan Feuerriegel", "crossmarkdomains[1]": "springer.com", "crossmarkdomains[2]": "springerlink.com", "crossmarkdomainexclusive": "true", "crossmarkmajorversiondate": "2010-04-23", "keywords": "Generative AI; Artificial intelligence; Decision support; Content creation; Information systems", "moddate": "2023-09-11T13:50:56+05:30", "subject": "Business & Information Systems Engineering, https://doi.org/10.1007/s12599-023-00834-7", "title": "Generative AI", "doi": "10.1007/s12599-023-00834-7", "robots": "noindex", "rgid": "PB:370653602_AS:11431281196092937@1696531787836", "source": "data\\uiiukyjyujty.pdf", "total_pages": 17, "page": 2, "page_label": "3", "start_index": 0}}
{"page_content": "Examples can be the joint probability distri- bution P(X, Y) of both the inputs and the outputs or P(Y), but where Y is typically from some high-dimensional space. By doing so, a generative model offers the ability to produce new synthetic samples (e.g., generate new obser- vation-target-pairs ( X, Y) or new observations X given a target value Y) (Bishop 2006).

The more natural AI systems become in terms of their interface and output, the more a theory of mind for human-computer interactions becomes necessary. Research is already investigating how AI systems can become theory-of-mind-aware to better understand their human counterpart (Rabinowitz et al. 2018;C¸ elikok et al. 2019).

This is owed to the underlying nature of machine learning models relying on probabilistic algo- rithms for making inferences. For example, generative AI models generate the most probable response to a prompt, not necessarily the correct response. As such, challenges arise as, by now, outputs are indistinguishable from authentic content and may present misinformation or deceive users (Spitale et al. 2023).

Bias and fairness. Societal biases permeate everyday human-generated content (Eskreis-Winkler and Fishbach 2022). The unbiasedness of vanilla generative AI is very much dependent on the quality of training data and the alignment process.

One open question relates to how generative AI can be effectively customized for domain-speciﬁc applications and thus improve perfor- mance through higher degrees of contextualization. For example, novel and scalable techniques are needed to customize conversational agents based on generative AI for applications in medicine or ﬁnance. This will be crucial in practice to solve speciﬁc BISE-related tasks where cus- tomization may bring additional performance gains. Novel techniques for customization must be designed in a way that ensures the safety of proprietary data and prevents the data from being disclosed.

Another important research direction is to improve the reliability of generative AI systems. For example, algo- rithmic solutions are needed on how generative AI can detect and mitigate hallucination. In addition to algorithmic solutions, more effort is also needed to develop user-cen- tered solutions, that is, how users can reduce the risk of falling for incorrect outcomes, for example, by developing better ways how outputs can be veriﬁed (e.g., by offering additional explanations or references).

Likewise, their construction and maintenance are time-consuming and expensive and require manual effort and human expertise (Silva et al. 2021). With generative AI, we see a large potential that many of these limitations can be addressed by generative AI as assistive technology (Sandkuhl et al. 2018), for example by automatically creating and updating enterprise models at different levels of abstraction or generating multi-modal representations.

If generative AI is used to co- create innovative outcomes, it may also enable better reﬂection of the different design activities to ensure the necessary learning (Schoormann et al. 2023a). 5 Conclusion Generative AI is a branch of AI that can create new content such as texts, images, or audio", "metadata": {"producer": "Acrobat Distiller 10.1.8 (Windows)", "creator": "Springer", "creationdate": "2023-09-11T13:47:48+05:30", "author": "Stefan Feuerriegel", "crossmarkdomains[1]": "springer.com", "crossmarkdomains[2]": "springerlink.com", "crossmarkdomainexclusive": "true", "crossmarkmajorversiondate": "2010-04-23", "keywords": "Generative AI; Artificial intelligence; Decision support; Content creation; Information systems", "moddate": "2023-09-11T13:50:56+05:30", "subject": "Business & Information Systems Engineering, https://doi.org/10.1007/s12599-023-00834-7", "title": "Generative AI", "doi": "10.1007/s12599-023-00834-7", "robots": "noindex", "rgid": "PB:370653602_AS:11431281196092937@1696531787836", "source": "data\\uiiukyjyujty.pdf", "total_pages": 17, "page": 13, "page_label": "14", "start_index": 0}}

For this reason, generative AI has the potential to transform domains and industries that rely on creativity, innovation, and knowledge processing. In particular, it enables new applications that were previously impossible or impractical for automation, such as realistic virtual assistants, personalized education and service, and digital art. As such, generative AI has substantial implications for BISE practitioners and scholars as an interdisciplinary research community.

{"page_content": "CATCHWORD Generative AI Stefan Feuerriegel • Jochen Hartmann • Christian Janiesch • Patrick Zschech Received: 29 April 2023 / Accepted: 7 August 2023 /C211The Author(s) 2023 Keywords Generative AI /C1 Artiﬁcial intelligence /C1 Decision support /C1 Content creation /C1 Information systems 1 Introduction Tom Freston is credited with saying ‘‘Innovation is taking two things that exist and putting them together in a new way’’.

Different from these works, we focus on generative AI in the context of information systems, and, to this end, we discuss several opportunities and challenges that are unique to the BISE community and make suggestions for impactful directions for BISE research. 2 Conceptualization 2.1 Mathematical Principles of Generative AI Generative AI is primarily based on generative modeling, which has distinctive mathematical differences from dis- criminative modeling (Ng and Jordan 2001) often used in data-driven decision support. In general, discriminative modeling tries to separate data points X into different classes Y by learning decision boundaries between them (e.g., in classiﬁcation tasks with Y 2f 0; 1g). In contrast to that, generative modeling aims to infer some actual data distribution. Examples can be the joint probability distri- bution P(X, Y) of both the inputs and the outputs or P(Y), but where Y is typically from some high-dimensional space.

Multimodal models exist across a variety of data modalities, for example for text, image, and audio.

Formally, diffusion probability models capture the image data by modeling the way data points diffuse through a latent space, which is inspired by statistical physics. Speciﬁcally, they typically use Markov chains trained with variational inference and then reverse the diffusion process to generate a natural image. A notable variant is Stable Diffusion (Rombach et al. 2022). Diffusion probability models are also used in commercial systems such as DALL-E and Midjourney.

This skill is crucial for social interactions, as it facilitates empathy and allows for effective communication. Moreover, conferring a mind to an AI system can substantially drive usage intensity (Hartmann et al. 2023a). The development of a theory of mind in humans is unconscious and evolves throughout an individual’s life.

This includes developing and evaluating design principles for generative AI systems and applications to extend the limiting boundaries of this technology (cf. Section 3).

Currently, design knowledge in the form of design requirements, design principles, and design features is often only available in encapsulated written papers or implicitly embedded in instantiated artifacts. Generative AI has the potential to extract such design knowledge that is spread over a broad body of interdisciplinary research and make it available in a collective form for scholars and practitioners. This could also overcome the limitation that design knowledge is currently rarely reused, which ham- pers the fundamental idea of knowledge accumulation in design science research (Schoormann et al. 2021).

Different from these works, we focus on generative AI in the context of information systems, and, to this end, we discuss several opportunities and challenges that are unique to the BISE community and make suggestions for impactful directions for BISE research. 2 Conceptualization 2.1 Mathematical Principles of Generative AI Generative AI is primarily based on generative modeling, which has distinctive mathematical differences from dis- criminative modeling (Ng and Jordan 2001) often used in data-driven decision support. In general, discriminative modeling tries to separate data points X into different classes Y by learning decision boundaries between them (e.g., in classiﬁcation tasks with Y 2f 0; 1g). In contrast to that, generative modeling aims to infer some actual data distribution. Examples can be the joint probability distri- bution P(X, Y) of both the inputs and the outputs or P(Y), but where Y is typically from some high-dimensional space.

By doing so, a generative model offers the ability to produce new synthetic samples (e.g., generate new obser- vation-target-pairs ( X, Y) or new observations X given a target value Y) (Bishop 2006). Building upon the above, a generative AI model refers to generative modeling that is instantiated with a machine learning architecture (e.g., a deep neural network) and, therefore, can create new data samples based on learned patterns. 1 Further, a generative AI system encompasses the entire infrastructure, including the model, data processing, and user interface components.

Similarly, ChatGPT combines techniques from generative modeling together with discriminatory modeling and reinforcement learning (see Fig. 2). 123 S.

Speciﬁcally, they typically use Markov chains trained with variational inference and then reverse the diffusion process to generate a natural image. A notable variant is Stable Diffusion (Rombach et al. 2022). Diffusion probability models are also used in commercial systems such as DALL-E and Midjourney.

Zero-shot learning is when a machine is taught how to learn a task from data without ever needing to access the data itself, while few-short learning refers to when there are only a few speciﬁc examples. Zero-shot learning and few-shot learning are often desirable in practice as they reduce the cost of setting up AI systems. LLMs are few-shot or zero-shot learners (Brown et al. 2020) as they just need a few samples to learn a task (e.g., predicting the sentiment of reviews), which makes LLMs highly ﬂexible as a general-purpose tool.

Recent studies expose the harmful biases embedded in multimodal generative AI models such as CLIP (contrastive language-image pre- training; Wolfe et al. 2022) and the CLIP-ﬁltered LAION dataset (Birhane et al. 2021), which are core components of generative AI models (e.g., Dall-E 2 or Stable Diffu- sion). Human biases can also creep into the models in other stages of the model engineering process. For instruction- based language models, the RLHF process is an additional source of bias (OpenAI 2023b). Careful coding guidelines and quality checks can help address these risks.
