The employment of machine-learning-based decision-support systems (MLDSS) in medicine, however, raises important multidisci - plinary challenges that cannot be addressed in isolation.

Behavioral issues relate to the actual impact that the system has on physicians. Technical issues arise with respect to the training of a machine learning (ML) model that gives accurate advice. We argue that the interaction between physicians and MLDSS including the concrete design of the interface in which this interaction occurs can only be considered at the intersection of all three disciplines. 1. Introduction Algorithms permeate our society. One important field of application is delivering advice in medical decision-making. In this domain, the use of the collaborative intelligence of context-sensitive humans and narrowly focused AI-powered machines promises substantial benefits for patients [ 1 ]. It could also help to reduce exploding costs in the healthcare sector as physicians may be able to save valuable time re - sources by utilizing decision support systems [ 2 ]. Inter alia, algorithms can be used to support physicians when making a diagnosis based on the content of medical images. The utilization of algorithms in medical decision-making, however, raises many questions and causes challenges at the intersection of several scientific disciplines. From the growing literature on AI- generated advice giving, we identified three distinct scientific perspec - tives that will have to be synthesized to achieve progress in human- centered MLDSS. The overarching guiding perspective is the ethical one. The task of this perspective is to discuss the appropriateness of traditional philosophical concepts like autonomy and responsibility for the realm of MLDSS. An essential question to be addressed here is whether the emergence of MLDSS in the context of medical decision- making causes responsibility gaps and whether the concept is adequate to capture the challenges of hybrid decision-making. To this purpose, we will argue, it may be helpful to consider the epistemic condition and the control condition separately. The epistemic condition refers to the question of how the generation of medical knowledge is transformed if the interaction between humans is increasingly replaced by hybrid interaction. The control condition tackles the problem of many hands in medical decision-making and problematizes how the attribution of responsibility may be maintained. To avoid that well-intended normative ideas unfold undesired con - sequences, the ethical perspective has to be complemented by the behavioral perspective. This perspective focuses on the empirical phe - nomena that arise from the interaction of humans and MLDSS. One key factor when it comes to using algorithms in the medical domain is physicians ’ trust in these systems [ 3 ]. The extent to which physicians rely on automated decision support will depend largely on this. It is owed to the fact that the mediation of human behavior by technology shapes this behavior through feeding back into preferences and beliefs.

{"page_content": "investigated the factors that influence trust between human advisors and advisees and established a phenomenon coined egocentric discounting. This describes an advisees’ tendency to give the advice inadequately little weight by primarily relying on their own beliefs. There is also growing research that studies human advisees’ trust in AI-based advisors that provides mixed evidence with some studies documenting less trust in algorithmic than human advisors (“algorithm aversion”) and others documenting the opposite (“algorithm appreciation”). Gaining a more systematic understanding of the drivers of trust in algorithms seems crucial to design a successful interaction between physicians and MLDSS. Finally, the technological perspective deals with the specific mate - rialization of the interaction between human decision-makers and MLDSS. There exist, of course, challenges that are of technological na - ture. These relate to training the algorithmic model and to fostering its accuracy in terms of a trade-off between specificity and sensitivity, i.e., optimizing the tension between avoiding false positives and false neg - atives alike. Given the widening space of technological opportunities, the scope of this perspective in isolation is only restricted by technical feasibility. It is by the empirically informed normative concepts derived from the first two perspectives that further restrictions are imposed on technological implementation. Not everything that is feasible should be done and other things that may be desirable may not (yet) be feasible. It is the task of the technological perspective to shift the limits of what is feasible. Technological progress in the realm of AI raises new ethical problems of opacity in algorithmic advice generation, that are now being addressed by technological advances in Explainable AI (XAI). A lot of research on hybrid interactions between humans and AI- based advisors is already done in the behavioral sciences and the tech - nological sciences. In our opinion, there is however a lacking exchange of these fields with technology ethics. Ethics is often detached from the empirical disciplines and engages in normative reflection on an often rather abstract level. Sometimes it remains unclear how these reflections are to be considered in a concrete technological interaction design. We therefore propose an interdisciplinary approach in which ethicists, behavioral scientists and computer scientists work jointly and in close exchange on the challenge of human-centered design by bringing in their own respective expertise. In this context, it should be emphasized that the relationship of the three perspectives is not reducible to a top- down relationship from the ethical via the behavioral to the technical perspective. The behavioral and technical implications of a specific design of the interaction between users and MLDSS may give rise to ethically relevant phenomena that will need to be subjects of reflection on the ethical level. This is particularly true of emergent ethical phe - nomena that were hard to anticipate in a world prior to the technolog - ical development in question. It is the aim of this article to elaborate on the multi-faceted problem of using MLDSS in medical decision-making by discussing three different disciplinary perspectives and their dependencies. Our intention is to show that the societal potential of utilizing ML models, in particular deep models, in medical decision-making can only be raised by addressing this technology holistically and in an interdisciplinary manner. To this aim, our article proceeds as follows. We will first discuss each perspective in isolation and summarize important problems viewed from each discipline separately. Afterwards, we will conclude by arguing for the need of synthesizing the three perspectives and by calling for an interdisciplinary research agenda on MLDSS in medicine. 2. Three disciplinary perspectives on AI-supported decision making in medicine 2.1. Ethical perspective The responsibility structure of classical medical diagnostic processes is – at least legally – clearly regulated, insofar as the attending physicians are responsible for the respective medical diagnosis as well as the subsequent indication and therapy plans [ 4 ]. In the discussion about the integration of MLDSS into these classical medical diagnostic pro - cesses, it is emphasized, in addition to the enumeration of weighty op - portunities, that the effective use of algorithms can produce responsibility diffusion or responsibility gaps with regard to the diag - nosis [ 5 ]. This in turn can have a particularly negative impact on pa - tients and their relatives [ 6 ]. 2.1.1. Responsibility gaps in medical decision-making? In principle, responsibility gaps in the field of technology ethics in their original sense describe a situation in which a complex as well as opaque autonomous system decides or acts independently, making both human control and insight into its decision almost impossible [ 7, 8 ]. However, since moral responsibility presupposes both “control” and “epistemic” cognition (Aristotle cited in Ref. [ 9, 10 ]), a gap in the attribution of responsibility arises in such scenarios [ 7 ] – because the autonomous system cannot be morally responsible either, due to the fact that it is not a moral actor [ 11, 12 ]. In contrast, with regard to the use of non-autonomously functioning MLDSS", "metadata": {"producer": "Acrobat Distiller 8.1.0 (Windows)", "creator": "Elsevier", "creationdate": "2025-04-26T10:33:58+00:00", "crossmarkdomains[1]": "elsevier.com", "crossmarkmajorversiondate": "2010-04-23", "creationdate--text": "26th April 2025", "elsevierwebpdfspecifications": "7.0.1", "robots": "noindex", "moddate": "2025-04-26T10:46:11+00:00", "author": "Jonas Ammeling", "doi": "10.1016/j.techsoc.2024.102791", "title": "An interdisciplinary perspective on AI-supported decision making in medicine", "keywords": "Machine learning,Decision-support system,Human-machine interaction,Medical image diagnosis,Ethically aligned design,Value-based design", "subject": "Technology in Society, 81 (2025) 102791. doi:10.1016/j.techsoc.2024.102791", "crossmarkdomains[2]": "sciencedirect.com", "crossmarkdomainexclusive": "true", "source": "data\\An-interdisciplinary-perspective-on-AI-supported-decisi_2025_Technology-in-S.pdf", "total_pages": 10, "page": 1, "page_label": "2", "start_index": 0}}

In contrast, with regard to the use of non-autonomously functioning MLDSS in the medical diagnostic pro - cess, it can be stated that this standard understanding of responsibility gaps falls short. This is because the use of the algorithm within medical diagnostics merely constitutes an element of the physician’s final diag - nosis and does not describe the autonomous final decision [ 13 ]. The result of an MLDSS is therefore considered one criterion among others, which the physician has to include and evaluate in the diagnosis. The physician remains in control; she is the final decision-maker. Thus, the diagnostic process remains the task of the medical professional and consequently the entire moral responsibility for the diagnosis can clearly be attributed to her, or so it seems. For even if in the medical context it is therefore less a question of “standard” responsibility gaps – there is no “loss of control” in the medical field caused by autonomous AI taking final decisions – the question of responsibility in the medical diagnostic process has not yet been fully clarified. In order to gain a more differentiated understanding of the attribution and structure of responsibility within a diagnostic process that utilizes MLDSS, the diagnostic situation should be reflected on with the help of the conditions of moral responsibility already described above: the “epistemic” and the “control” condition. In the context of MLDSS, the epistemic condition refers to the question of how knowledge is produced if a medical specialist “cooperates” with an MLDSS that feeds information into the specialist’s decision-making process. The control condition builds on this condition, as the synthe - sized knowledge produced will co-determine the decision that is taken by the human, and raises the specific questions of who is actually in control in hybrid constellations of physicians and MLDSS and how substantial human control can be maintained in these contexts of many hands. 2.1.2. The epistemic condition Let us start with some thoughts on the epistemic condition: A physician is considered a “domain-relative ʻepistemic authorit[y]ʼ” [ 14 ] – an expert in her respective medical field – who, with regard to the diagnostic process, has the task of reflectively applying her medical knowledge. This knowledge is composed of a “variety of methods and heuristics (e.g., ‘consensus conferences’, ‘evidence-based medicine’, ‘translational medicine’, and ‘narrative medicine’)” [ 14 ] to the patient’s specific individual disease situation (see also [ 15 ]). However, this “interpretative capacity that examines, evaluates, and selects the exist - ing medical knowledge” [ 14 ] is considerably undermined by the opaque nature of the algorithm, insofar as it is only possible to a limited extent for the medical professional to interpret the result of the MLDSS and thus become aware of faulty outputs [ 11 ]. Nevertheless, this does not imply that the focus should be on the MLDSS as a “technical disruptive factor” when attributing responsibility – conventional medicine is by no means free of knowledge gaps either J. Ammeling et al.

{"page_content": "[ 16 ]. Instead, the focus should be on the contextual transformations and differences that arise during a diagnostic process that utilizes MLDSS. The handling of “second opinions” becomes crucial in this context. Even though an evaluation of a MLDSS is just one piece of information that a physician considers when making a diagnosis, it still must be taken into account. In a conventional diagnostic process involving two physicians, there can be an exchange of arguments in the event of opposing views. However, this is not possible in the case of a ML-supported diagnosis [ 17 ]. This limitation is not only due to the fact that the evaluation of a MLDSS is based on statistical correlations and differs from a physician’s judgment but also because a MLDSS cannot engage in a dialogue to provide arguments, reasons or explanations – even if the ML-supported result can be interpreted using XAI methods. Philosophically, questions arise of what constitutes an explanation. One may insistthat the physi - cian is in fact not given discursive reasons by the “partner.” While methods using explanatory cycles (e.g., Ref. [ 18 ]) try to approximate such discourses, they will fall short of respective human capabilities in the eyes of many. Ultimately, what constitutes a convincing advice or meaningful explanation still depends on the physician’s – or the pa - tient’s – judgment [ 14, 17 ]. In this context, it is particularly important to focus on the patient (and, if relevant, her relatives). From the physician’s duty to inform, the principle of “informed consent” or the model of a deliberative physician- patient relationship with “shared agency”, it becomes clear that the epistemic aspect and the moral responsibility of physicians are inherent in a relational dimension from the very beginning – namely towards the patients [ 19, 20 ]. It is the individual situation of the patient that requires a diagnosis, and this diagnosis is to be justified towards her. The patient herself is also part of the diagnostic process, as she helps to develop it from her personal history and, in turn, has to incorporate it “meaning - fully” into her self-understanding [ 14, 21 ]. So, patient communication requires a certain amount of information and knowledge, which are significantly restricted by the opacity of the algorithm, in order to be able to “speak and answer” meaningfully [ 11, 14, 21 ]. In this regard, both the interpretive task of the physician in the diagnostic process and the communicative aspect are integral to the core responsibilities of medical practice. Therefore, the question arises as to whether the physician can still be held morally responsible if the use of a MLDSS leads to structural and integral changes in the diagnostic process. In particular, interpretation and communication are impaired episte - mically by, for example, the opaque nature of the algorithm, which is not entirely comprehensible and interpretable by its users [ 22 ]. Further - more, the MLDSS lacks a reasoning structure that would allow the physician to meaningfully integrate the additional information from the MLDSS into the diagnosis, especially in the case of conflicting opinions. So, there is still the risk of a gap in responsibility or responsibility diffusion – at the epistemic level. It is important to examine here, on the one hand, the requirements that actors in the medical context – partic - ularly physicians and patients – have to meet. On the other hand, the design of the algorithm as well as human-machine interaction hold considerable importance. In this regard, it appears valuable to consider the aspect of “forward-looking responsibility” ([ 23 ]) to proactively define the respective responsibilities of individual actors in advance and thereby prevent the diffusion of responsibility [ 13, 24, 25 ]. 2.1.3. The control condition Secondly, it should be noted that the condition of control is also in question due to the transformed diagnostic process. Even though the physician represents the final link in the diagnostic process and is responsible for integrating the MLDSS into the diagnosis, biases or incorrect decisions relating to the development process of the MLDSS, e. g. “during the data collection and acquisition process” [ 5 ], can be inherent to the algorithm and consequently falsely affect the diagnosis. A medical professional who has acted in accordance with her duty of care and has relied on the MLDSS – e. g., due to her experience or on the recommendation of a regulatory authority – is not responsible for the data fed into the algorithm or its development. Instead, with the incorporation of an algorithm into the diagnostic process, additional actors come into focus. This is referred to as the “problem of many hands and many things” [ 19 ]. Those who have been involved in development and distribution of MLDSS now might play a role in the question of moral responsibility [ 5 ]. The use of MLDSS in medicine thus leads to a disruptive change in", "metadata": {"producer": "Acrobat Distiller 8.1.0 (Windows)", "creator": "Elsevier", "creationdate": "2025-04-26T10:33:58+00:00", "crossmarkdomains[1]": "elsevier.com", "crossmarkmajorversiondate": "2010-04-23", "creationdate--text": "26th April 2025", "elsevierwebpdfspecifications": "7.0.1", "robots": "noindex", "moddate": "2025-04-26T10:46:11+00:00", "author": "Jonas Ammeling", "doi": "10.1016/j.techsoc.2024.102791", "title": "An interdisciplinary perspective on AI-supported decision making in medicine", "keywords": "Machine learning,Decision-support system,Human-machine interaction,Medical image diagnosis,Ethically aligned design,Value-based design", "subject": "Technology in Society, 81 (2025) 102791. doi:10.1016/j.techsoc.2024.102791", "crossmarkdomains[2]": "sciencedirect.com", "crossmarkdomainexclusive": "true", "source": "data\\An-interdisciplinary-perspective-on-AI-supported-decisi_2025_Technology-in-S.pdf", "total_pages": 10, "page": 2, "page_label": "3", "start_index": 0}}

Those who have been involved in development and distribution of MLDSS now might play a role in the question of moral responsibility [ 5 ]. The use of MLDSS in medicine thus leads to a disruptive change in the existing structure of responsibility, insofar as there is now a risk of incorrectly attributing responsibility, failing to fulfill responsibilities, or “passing the buck” to other actors. The attri - bution of responsibility becomes diffuse and, in turn, carries the jeop - ardy of a responsibility gap [ 5 ]. It is therefore clear that “responsibility as a multidimensional and relational concept” [ 5 ] needs to be under - stood and differentiated within the context of medical decision-making. To meaningfully identify responsibilities, the concept of “meaningful human control” appears promising. It attempts to identify all relevant actors within the medical diagnostic context and analyzes their duties, roles, moral reasons, and responsibilities, thus re-establishing attribu - tions of responsibility [ 8, 26 ]. In summary, the employment of MLDSS in medical decision-making contexts raises a plethora of challenging ethical questions. It seems useful to focus on the epistemic and control condition in AI-supported decision-making because moral responsibility presupposes control and epistemic cognition. A focus of the epistemic condition is on impair - ments of a physician’s opportunities to interpret information and communicate it to a patient due to an MLDSS’s opaqueness. While methods of XAI work intensively to address this challenge, one might argue that the explanatory discourse of humans can only be imperfectly approximated in hybrid constellations. The control condition focuses on “meaningful human control” in light of the “problem of many hands and things.” It thus deals with problems of responsibility diffusion between physicians, developers and other actors in a technologically permeated medical decision-making context. 2.2. Behavioral science perspective Utilizing MLDSS in medical diagnostic processes constitutes a com - plex decision-making situation where physicians are the decision- makers and the technical system is the advisor. The optimal way to facilitate the interaction between human medical experts and MLDSS is non-trivial and varies depending on the specific application. In the following, we will first look at some determinants of trust in human advice identified in the literature and then consider hybrid advice-giving situations. 2.2.1. Determinants of trust in human advice The determinants of advisees’ trust in advice from other humans can be broadly categorized into factors that relate to characteristics of (1.) the advisee him- or herself, (2.) the advisor and (3.) the decision-making context. Advisees are keen to preserve a favorable (self-)image and are consequently less likely to seek advice if they fear that this advice- seeking makes them appear incompetent [ 27 ]. Moreover, there is a strong negative correlation between people’s level of confidence in their decision-making and their inclination to seek advice in the first place [ 28 ] or to give weight to it once they receive it [ 28–30 ]. Consequently, if advisees’ confidence is fostered by more experience through longer tenure or by perceptions of high power within their organization, they tend to seek less advice [ 31 ]. A systematic investigation of advice seeking reveals that subjective confidence predicts decision-makers’ propensity to seek and use advice and that, conversely, their advice-seeking behavior is a reliable proxy for subjective confidence [ 32 ]. The same seems to be true for the advisor, as perceived self-competence also tends to increase people’s desire to influence others by providing advice [ 33 ]. Further evidence on determinants of a decision-makers inclination to seek advice concerns the characteristics of the advisor. Advisees prefer J. Ammeling et al.

{"page_content": "those advisors to whom they ascribe expertise and those who resemble themselves more closely [ 34 ]. For example, advisors within an organi - zation are often preferred over external advisors. It was found that in a task in which decision-makers were advised by three peers, a single peer who confirmed a decision-maker’s own initial judgment clearly decreased the influence of the other more distant peers [ 35 ]. Further - more, advisees are more likely to seek advice from advisors whom they assume have positive feelings toward them [ 36 ]. In a recent meta-analysis of 129 independent datasets on advice-taking, the only unique predictor of the weight of advice was information about the advisor that influenced decision-makers’ perception of advice quality [ 37 ]. A third determinant relates to the characteristics of the context in which the advice is being made, it has been demonstrated that decision- makers tend to seek more advice if the situation involves more uncer - tainty [ 38–40 ]. They are also more likely to solicit additional advice in situations in which the advice that they received was more dissimilar to their initial opinion [ 41 ]. The cited studies often rely on stylized esti - mation tasks with a convenience sample of undergraduate students in which these are shown pictures of glasses filled with coins and have to guess their number [ 30 ], estimate tuition fees for different colleges [ 29 ] or caloric content of various foods per serving [ 41 ]. Studies with pro - fessionals mostly focus on business contexts, studying advice-seeking on strategic issues or cost-cutting measures by CEOs [ 34, 39 ], entrepre - neurial teams in software ventures [ 38 ] or alumni of top-ranked busi - ness schools [ 27 ]. 2.2.2. The phenomenon of egocentric discounting Generally, it has been established that advisees exhibit “egocentric discounting” in quantitative estimation tasks where advice is present. This bias implies that decision-makers place more weight on their own estimates than on their advisor’s [ 42, 43 ] and has by now been consol - idated in numerous studies of estimation tasks which have shown that decision-makers adjust, on average, about one third of the distance from their initial estimate to the advisor’s [ 28, 44–46 ]. In a more recent re - view, the authors conclude that the social information waste caused by egocentric discounting cannot be explained away with a single-cause account which stresses the importance of studying it from the perspec - tives of multiple research traditions [ 47 ]. One proposed explanation resonates with the first determinant of trust mentioned above. Advisees privy their own thoughts but not those of others which means that they know the reasons for which they hold their own initial opinions, while the reasons for which their advisors hold theirs remain dubious. Ac - cording to several authors, it is this asymmetry that may lead to the decision-maker’s egocentric discounting of other people’s advice ([ 41 ]; [ 48 ]; [ 45, 49 ]). In line with this explanation is the fact that decision-makers who had not previously generated an initial estimate themselves, i.e., who had not formed their own rationale, tended to make quantitative estimates that were closer to those provided by their advisors [ 50, 51 ]. This also suggests that egocentric discounting is smaller if the advisor is perceived to be more similar to oneself as sug - gested by the second determinant introduced above. The third determinant, being the context of decision-making, may be of special interest, because it seems most amendable by intentional design. In this respect, it has been found that egocentric discounting seems somewhat less pronounced in task environments where choices are binary instead of continuous, such as in a card game task, in which participants could “stay” with a card of known value or “switch” to a card of unknown value [ 52 ]. Participants were sensitive to the advice of whether to stay or switch and use the advice strategically depending on the information that they knew the advisor had about the value of the card unknown to them. Here, the authors conclude that the participants engage successfully in mental-state reasoning by “putting two heads together” and integrating their own knowledge and the advisor’s com - plementary knowledge to improve their decision. For instance, they ignored the advice if they knew that the advisor could not see any cards and followed it if the advisor could see both cards.

{"page_content": "were sensitive to the advice of whether to stay or switch and use the advice strategically depending on the information that they knew the advisor had about the value of the card unknown to them. Here, the authors conclude that the participants engage successfully in mental-state reasoning by “putting two heads together” and integrating their own knowledge and the advisor’s com - plementary knowledge to improve their decision. For instance, they ignored the advice if they knew that the advisor could not see any cards and followed it if the advisor could see both cards. This may suggest that the level of uncertainty inherent in decision-making is another impor - tant driver of a decision-maker’s reliance in ML-generated advice. Having more information, for instance, about the data on which the ML-generated advice is based could increase advisees’ inclination to adopt it. 2.2.3. Implications for trust in machine advice The literature on advice-based decision making where the advisor is a human, taken as a whole, thus indicates that decision makers tend to underweight rather than overweight advice. It is important to investi - gate whether this general finding carries over to constellations where the advisor is a machine instead of a human. The literature on these hybrid constellations is growing but still scarcer than the one referring to interhuman constellations. Which difference might one expect prima facie? An important factor that is likely to determine how ML-generated advice is received and utilized is the emotional dimension of the advice. This will likely depend on the affective attitude that the decision-maker has toward the MLDSS as opposed to a human expert. Given that the advisee’s perception of the advisor has been found to be an important determinant of trust it seems important to understand how they perceive MLDSS. This may of course be influenced directly by the human-AI interface or more indirectly by other characteristics of the interaction. For instance, the way the advice is communicated to the decision-maker might matter, as it is likely to induce feelings of dominance over, sub - ordination to or partnership with the MLDSS in the advisee. Another factor that is likely to play a role is the dissimilarity between the ML- generated advice and the perspective of the decision-maker. It has been found that pooling individual information to achieve collective intelligence is particularly successful if it capitalizes on individual het - erogeneity [ 53 ]. Given the explanation of egocentric discounting cited above that decision-makers have difficulties to understand an advisor’s thoughts, however, one might expect that a machine’s “rationale” for giving a specific advice is perceived as even more opaque and thus dubious. In this sense, the MLDSS’s advice may be perceived as more dissimilar from the decision-maker’s perspective than the advice of a fellow human advisor. This may also be due to the fact that humans have a harder time emphasizing with artificial advisors and that building a theory of mind of entities whose inner workings seem alien to them comes less natural. Similarly, the observations that decision-makers are more likely to accept advice from people who resemble them or whom they ascribe more positive feelings towards them might suggest that humans are more likely to discount the advice of unfamiliar artificial agents. Overall, these considerations may suggest an even stronger discounting of the advice of artificial as compared to human advisors. Contrary to this, however, decision-makers may also be aware that artificial agents are tasked to attain a certain and clearly defined objective, while people’s motives often may be more ambiguous. Relatedly, it might be the case that artificial agents that are designed to be “sympathetic” to decision-makers are perceived as being less contemptuous or dominant than human experts and appear thus more likable. These opposed intuitions seem to suggest a higher reliance on artificial agents’ as opposed to human agents’ advice. The tendency to trust or distrust in AI-generated compared to human advice is likely to depend substantially on the experience that individual decision-makers have made with MLDSS and the degree to which they are used to working with these entities. Chong et al. (2022) have shown that deci - sion-makers’ individual experience with AI-assisted decision-making has a profound influence on their reliance on the advice through the effect that the collaboration has on their self-confidence. From a meta- analysis on trust in AI, Kaplan et al. [ 54 ] conclude that the interaction between the many different antecedents of trust in AI has not been empirically investigated. Promoting this kind of research is important, particularly in ethically charged contexts like medicine. J. Ammeling et al.

{"page_content": "2.2.4. Algorithm aversion vs. algorithm appreciation Several research findings point to the phenomenon of algorithm aversion, implyingthat humans underuse or mistrust artificial agents’ compared to human agents’ advice. These findings show that humans do not distrust artificial agents in principle and from the outset but depending on their expectations about their own and the algorithm’s performance, experience with the artificial advisor and the context of the task. Informational mechanisms that are linked to the perceived competence of the advisor seem to play a stronger role for human-robot interactions than for interhuman interactions which are highly co- determined by social normative mechanisms [ 55 ]. The perception of the MLDSS as a superior intelligence seems important as expectations are easily disappointed. If decision-makers see a forecasting algorithm err, their algorithm aversion increases, even when they see it outperform a human forecaster [ 56 ]. Concerning the decision-making context, it has been found that algorithm aversion is more pronounced for tasks that seem subjective in nature [ 57 ]. With increased difficulty in intellective tasks with clearly correct answers, subjects in three experiments relied more on algorithmic advice with increasing difficulty [ 58 ]. It is suggested that algorithm aversion is driven by biased evaluations of human capabilities and tends to be stronger in domains where people’s identity is threatened [ 59 ]. In line with this, trust in algorithms can be brought about by the opportunity to (even slightly) modify an imperfect forecasting algorithm, i.e., by the decision-makers’ feeling of being more in control [ 60 ]. Finally, Dietvorst and Bharti [ 61 ] found that trust in algorithms will depend on the un - certainty inherent in the decision domain and that people have dimin - ishing sensitivity to forecasting error which lets them rely on riskier human judgment. They suspect that people may be unwilling to use even the best possible algorithms in inherently uncertain domains like med - ical decision-making. Algorithm appreciation describes the opposite phenomenon that decision-makers adhere more to advice from algorithms than from persons. In a sequence of six experiments, people showed algorithm appreciation when making numeric estimates about visual stimuli and forecasts about song popularity and romantic attraction [ 62 ]. In contrast to results cited above, it has also been reported that an increased trust in algorithmic advisors does not erode when decision-makers are informed of the algorithm’s prediction errors [ 63 ] or when they knowingly interact with dubious algorithms ([ 64 ]). Research on automation bias focuses on the problems that are caused by users’ failure to recognize new errors that are introduced by automated advice [ 65, 66 ]. Hou and Jung [ 67 ] have attempted to reconcile the contradicting phenomena of algorithm appreciation and algorithm aversion in AI-supported decision-making. Their research focuses on the importance of how humans and algorithms are framed in the different studies. They argue that different framings produce the inconsistent results of algo - rithm aversion and algorithm appreciation observed in previous studies. According to the authors, framing refers to the relative description of the human and of the artificial advisor: what kind of people and what kind of algorithm are we comparing? The importance of framing emphasizes the need to investigate to which degree advice by artificial agents in the medical domain is sought and weighted and how this compares to advice by humans. Among several personal factors like a physician’s level of experience and general confidence, this will probably also depend on features that are amendable to the design of the interaction, i.e., factors that concern the perception of the advisor or the decision situation. These factors could, based on previous results, consist in the information that the algorithm provides regarding the criteria on which it based its advice or in emphasizing the uncertainty of the situation by communi - cating its own imperfect confidence in the accuracy of the advice. Even the sequence of the interaction can have an impact on decision-making [ 68 ]. To sum up, the behavioral perspective focuses so far mainly on an advisees’ trust in the advice as determined by participants’ behavioral tendency to follow it in their choices. Especially in behavioral experiments, these choices are often consequential as they imply lower monetary payoffs if participants perform worse. Interhuman advice giving has been studied extensively and determinants that relate to characteristics of the advisee him- or herself, the perception of the advisor and the decision-making context were identified. Hybrid in - teractions of human and AI are increasingly studied but behavioral ev - idence is still much scarcer. There is mixed empirical evidence on algorithm aversion and algorithm aversion with few attempts to reconcile these phenomena.

Technical perspective Machine learning algorithms, especially those using complex (deep) networks, are being perceived as “black boxes” [ 69 ], and their use in safety critical environments such as autonomous driving or in the medical context is met with criticism. This is likely rooted in the inability of an observer to understand such complex systems and not in a lack of transparency regarding the model and its individual components and values. To overcome these limitations, van Lent et al. [ 70 ] introduced the concept of XAI already in the early days of AI, which should provide the user with an “easily understood chain of reasoning”. XAI has been a very dynamic field of research centered around developing technologies to make machine learning models more interpretable. Methods in XAI typically aim to either explain the decision for a single data instance (local explanations) or to provide a global explanation of the model’s decision-making process across all data instances. In the context of the medical diagnostic process, local explanations are of highest relevance, as they help clinicians understand the specific reasons behind a model’s prediction for an individual case. 2.3.1. Explainability of deep machine-learning models One approach to achieving explainability is through the employment of inherently interpretable models, such as linear regression or compact decision trees. This, however, has been criticized for resulting in re - strictions in machine learning model design, which can lead to lower performance of those models [ 71 ]. Initially, researchers have focused on post-hoc, model-agnostic interpretability methods. These methods preserve the structure and performance of machine learning models by analyzing them through their input-output relationships. One example of this is the communi - cation of prototypical input space representatives of a decision (e.g., exemplary images) together with ‘criticisms’ (non-prototypical exam - ples of the same class) [ 72 ]. Contrastive methods offer another layer of insight by explaining why a particular decision was made in contrast to other potential decisions [ 73 ]. For example, these methods aim to clarify why a medical model diagnosed one disease instead of another similar disease, enhancing our understanding of the model’s decision-making process. Another similar method is the use of counterfactuals, which provide examples that demonstrate how slight modifications in the input could change the model’s decision [ 74 ]. For instance, a chest x-ray image with a certain model diagnosis could be contrasted to how the same patient’s image could look like for another diagnosis [ 75 ]. All of these methods, which essentially show and contrast exemplary behaviors of the model, follow the idea of familiarizing the user with the model and aligning expectations with the actual behavior. More recently, the design of deep model architectures that are explainable by design has received growing interest. The core idea is to incorporate the pattern matching capabilities of modern deep neural networks (and hence to achieve highly performant models), with inherently explainable methods. For instance, the PIP-Net approach by Nauta et al. [ 76 ], 2024) uses convolutional feature extraction in the early layers of the network, providing high non-linear pattern recogni - tion capacity, followed by spatial aggregation and linear combination, which are inherently explainable methods. This allows for a “scoring J. Ammeling et al.

{"page_content": "card” interpretation, facilitating insight into how predictions are made. Unfortunately, this structure also comes with a trade-off: while increasing explainability, the model’s ability to capture and recombine more complex spatial patterns is constrained, potentially limiting its overall performance. The very property of being inherently explainable (in the last part of the model) limits the model to discover and map more complex spatial relationships in the input image. Furthermore, while the first part of the model, which performs a more complex pattern matching against intuitive prototypes, is in fact a powerful pattern recognizer, it has some of the same black box properties that have been criticized and may be vulnerable to challenges such as adversarial at - tacks and unpredictable performance on out-of-distribution cases. 2.3.2. Limits of explainability The remainder of the section focuses on the discussion of the limits of explainability that has been emphasized by some authors. The idea that explanation is limited is that the methods discussed aid in understanding the model in a local context of the input space, but fall short of achieving comprehensive or holistic interpretability as defined by Miller et al. (2019), i.e., that a human can understand the cause of a decision, which is crucial for applications like medical MLDSS, where understanding the entire decision-making process, in particular also for edge cases, is important. This limitation is especially relevant for increasingly large models (e.g., large language models and other recent foundation models) and becomes particularly evident in the case of images and text as input, which is the most prevalent scenario in medical MLDSS. Exemplary images alone communicate only distinct modes of the data, thereby falling short of providing a comprehensive understanding of the model’s decision-making process. Furthermore, these examples are typically drawn from a certain data distribution, which may not be representative of the target distribution in actual use cases [ 77 ]. For example, models trained on data from one demographic might perform unpredictably when applied to a different demographic, due to covariant data distribution shifts [ 78 ]. These shifts can result in unexpected and potentially harmful model predictions. Even further, they might be contradictory to the expectations of the user that were established during familiarization, e.g., by using counterfac - tuals, prototypes and criticisms. This highlights a critical aspect in assessing the reliability of large models: the effectiveness of these models is inherently linked to the representativeness of the data used during training and user familiar - ization. Typically, training data lacks uniform representation across different conditions, such as different demographic groups or clinical scenarios, which can lead to inherent biases in model behavior. Simi - larly, these representational imbalances can introduce perceptual biases in the explainability of models. While explainability methods can certainly help to detect biases in models and/or datasets, they are also dependent on the data distribution. Explainability patterns, which are derived from training data, might not accurately reflect the actual use case scenarios, leading to misleading or incomplete explanations. 2.3.3. The consequences of non-explainability Consequently, achieving explainability in model decisions is a complex and nuanced topic of research. The clinical utility of explain - ability methods is not yet fully understood, and it is still unclear whether the diagnostic process will be positively influenced by it ([ 79 ]; [ 80 ]). Explainable methods might also be persuasive and increase cognitive biases [ 81 ]. This may raise an important question: while explainability is very much desirable – are we perhaps focusing too strongly on inter - pretability at the expense of other crucial aspects? While the call for transparency or traceability of the reasoning of the algorithm is easy to comprehend, it could also be considered a case of an anthropomorphic fallacy [ 82 ]: Potentially based upon a perceived parallelism of a human medical expert and a medical decision support system, we assume the algorithm to reason and decide, ignoring that the very nature of today’s (large) machine learning models does not include reason or a conscious decision. Machine learning systems work by optimizing what can be described as a gigantic equation that incorporates lots of variables, typically with the target of maximizing the correlation to the desired output and reducing the number and magnitude of errors such a system makes. This is very different to human reasoning, which is ideally based on the logical combination of verified assumptions, but also subject to an often- underestimated number of known fallacies and biases [ 83–85 ]. The re - striction of AI methods to models that are logically understandable, is also known to restrict the complexity and hence the capability, versa - tility, or efficiency of said models [ 71 ]. If the introduction of trans - parency into machine learning model design comes at the cost of reduced performance, this directly leads to a moral dilemma. 2.3.4.

Not interpretable but safe and effective In the realm of medical research, however, one may argue that withholding a particular treatment or medication solely due to an incomplete comprehension of its mechanism of action can be ethically problematic, particularly when the treatment’s efficacy has been comprehensively substantiated, and its potential side effects and in - teractions have been fully identified. This seemsparticularly true for the function of well-known and widely used drugs, such as the painkiller paracetamol [ 86 ] or the anesthetic ketamine [ 87 ], which have been used for decades besides a poorly understood mechanism of action. In laboratory testing of diagnostic samples (such as blood and other bodily liquids), it has well been accepted that the nature of a test result is purely statistical and, in practice, subject to many factors that can in - fluence the test outcome that are rooted in the preparation of the sam - ples [ 88 ] and hence hard to trace in retrospect. Each test method is known to be subject to a defined set of statistical properties (e.g., recall and specificity for the detection of a disease, standard error of a mea - surement) and to be used only given a defined set of circumstances (such as mode of application or even patient population) that the method has been validated for [ 89 ]. This could serve as a blueprint for ML in medical decision making: Given properly and independently validated ML models, where the boundary conditions of the use (i.e., the expected data distribution) are described in sufficient detail [ 90 ], the potential risks to safety are mitigated and the benefit through efficiency and performance outweighs the risks. In summary, while explainability seems desirable for machine learning models and a lot of progress in the field of explainable AI in recent years allows for better explainability even of deep learning models, increased explainability may come at the cost of reduced ac - curacy. At the same time, the lack of independent validation for many AI models poses its own risks, potentially leading to generalization errors that reduce accuracy in clinical settings. To ensure reliable performance, robust validation of MLDSS using sufficiently large and, most impor - tantly, representative datasets is essential and the precondition to their application being safe and effective. Ultimately, the question of whether explainability should take precedence over accuracy is not just a tech - nical one. It is a question where the patient as the primary stakeholder should be involved as well. 3. The need for interdisciplinary exchange The utilization of MLDSS in medical decision-making raises impor - tant scientific questions with a high relevance for society. In a way, the scientific questions that MLDSS pose at the ethical and behavioral level are even more fundamental than the technical ones. On the one hand, ethical issues arise regarding changes in the responsibility structures in healthcare that may be caused by the introduction of decision-support systems. Can we still reliably assign individual responsibility in case of a medical error or is the responsibility of physician, algorithm devel - oper, regulator and the hospital management implementing the hybrid interaction diffused to such a degree that individual responsibility J.

{"page_content": "dissipates? In case of the latter, may it be ethically appropriate to withhold a decision-support system from a patient even though its performance has been comprehensively validated or does performance trump transparency and clear attribution of responsibility? When does one outweigh the other? On the other hand, issues in behavioral sciences arise at the level of the actual effects that the interaction between physicians and algorithms has on the diagnostic process and thus ultimately on the patient. An extensive literature on advice-based decision-making reveals many factors at play in human-human interactions. To what extent do these results transfer to human-AI interactions? How can physicians’ trust in decision-support systems and reliance on the systems’ advice be increased or decreased through specific design of the interaction, the human-machine interface or the way the system “justifies” its advice? How do we resolve the potential tension between explainability and accuracy of machine learning models and, in particular, who decides which trade-offs are acceptable in this regard? 3.1. Toward a normatively and empirically informed technical implementation These ethical and behavioral questions ought to be addressed before any adequate comprehensive technical solution can be even conceptu - alized, let alone implemented. Conceptual issues regarding re - sponsibility as posed by ethics will be essential to judge whether MLDSS should give specific advice at all or whether they should only help to structure the decision situation by, for instance, highlighting segments of a given medical image that the physician should turn her attention to. Moreover, ethicists and behavioral scientists need to join the debate in computer science about the importance and usefulness of explainability in machine learning models, especially when there are trade-offs be - tween explainability and model performance. All of this would have direct implications for the design of the human-algorithm interaction through the information that the system’s interface communicates to the diagnostician. Similarly, empirical phenomena regarding any influences that the advice has on the diagnostician will be crucial for a compre - hensive assessment of the technology. Assume that it is found that a certain kind of representation of the system’s advice makes it system - atically more likely that the diagnostician will follow the advice. From an ethical view, it is important to decide whether intentionally exploiting this effect to foster adherence to the system’s advice is legitimate or whether it undermines the physician’s autonomy in an unacceptable way. Only if the respective manipulation is considered morally legitimate would the identified behavioral implications be used to actively shape the human-system interaction accordingly through the concrete technical design. It therefore becomes clear that it is by no means sufficient to discuss each perspective’s challenges in isolation but indispensable to take an interdisciplinary perspective on the challenges raised. The examples stated above illustrate how all the perspectives are interrelated and that scientists working in each field have to complement each other to enable human-centeredness in AI-supported medical decision-making. It takes behavioral scientists to explore the factors influencing the interaction, computer scientists and XAI researchers to improve the performance of machine-learning algorithms with due consideration of possible influ - encing factors, and it takes ethicists to work out any red lines in the application of these systems in medical practice. It is clear that different methodologies and terminology can lead to misunderstanding and skepticism between disciplines. But if the goal is ethically aligned, human-centered AI, then this endeavor necessarily transcends the expertise of any single discipline. Although there is already important work on the impact of AI-based systems on users being done in XAI research (for an overview, see for instance, Ref. [ 91–93 ]), the focus of this research is usually not on ethically motivated questions. Focusing on the ethical implications of human-AI interaction will inevitably lead to the definition of different dependent variables and different experimental manipulations than the ones that behavioral scientists and computer scientists will typically address. Ethicists alone, however, will hardly be able to investigate the complex interplay between human behavior and technical artifacts without profound expertise from behavioral and computer science. In the following, we will outline two illustrations of how the three per - spectives discussed in this article interlock with each other and how a fruitful interdisciplinary exchange could look like. 3.2. Example 1: The Impact of Epistemic vs. Ethical Advice Most tasks that were cited in the behavioral perspective of this article were epistemic tasks in which advisees received advice on a knowledge problem. As discussed, there are important behaviorally oriented studies on the effect of XAI that refer to the question of whether certain means of explainability make advisees trust more in the advice. These studies systematically vary explanatory features of the MLDSS to study their influence on human performance and satisfaction of the explanation. There are, however, ethically highly relevant features of the decision situation that remain typically out of scope in this research. One crucial aspect relates to the diffusion of responsibility between the user and an MLDSS. Several ethicists assume that responsibility can categorically not be attributed to AI-based systems [ 94", "metadata": {"producer": "Acrobat Distiller 8.1.0 (Windows)", "creator": "Elsevier", "creationdate": "2025-04-26T10:33:58+00:00", "crossmarkdomains[1]": "elsevier.com", "crossmarkmajorversiondate": "2010-04-23", "creationdate--text": "26th April 2025", "elsevierwebpdfspecifications": "7.0.1", "robots": "noindex", "moddate": "2025-04-26T10:46:11+00:00", "author": "Jonas Ammeling", "doi": "10.1016/j.techsoc.2024.102791", "title": "An interdisciplinary perspective on AI-supported decision making in medicine", "keywords": "Machine learning,Decision-support system,Human-machine interaction,Medical image diagnosis,Ethically aligned design,Value-based design", "subject": "Technology in Society, 81 (2025) 102791. doi:10.1016/j.techsoc.2024.102791", "crossmarkdomains[2]": "sciencedirect.com", "crossmarkdomainexclusive": "true", "source": "data\\An-interdisciplinary-perspective-on-AI-supported-decisi_2025_Technology-in-S.pdf", "total_pages": 10, "page": 6, "page_label": "7", "start_index": 0}}

There are, however, ethically highly relevant features of the decision situation that remain typically out of scope in this research. One crucial aspect relates to the diffusion of responsibility between the user and an MLDSS. Several ethicists assume that responsibility can categorically not be attributed to AI-based systems [ 94 ]. Empirical research, however, sug - gests that people factually tend to ascribe responsibility to MLDSS in the context of medical image diagnosis and that this is especially the case if they attribute consciousness to the system [ 95 ]. The psychological re - ality of people shifting responsibility to MLDSS may, however, have implications for a physician’s willingness to take risk (see also [ 17 ]). Behaviorally, the desire to shift responsibility to an MLDSS will be re - flected in one’s willingness to rely on the system’s advice. To study the empirical relevance of this ethically motivated question a behavioral research design that is embedded in a concretely designed context of human-AI interaction is needed. This is an example of a challenge that can only be addressed by the three perspectives working together and thereby tackling the problem holistically. The ethically informed concept of responsibility diffusion is first to be operationalized in a concrete behavioral design. This can be done, for instance, by varying the perception of a given task as either primarily epistemic or primarily ethical. One possibility would be to frame the decision-making scenario by making its epistemic or ethical nature more salient. Another means for doing so is the use of either self-regarding or other-regarding incentives for the correct classification of images in laboratory studies. Self-regarding incentives mean that an advisee re - ceives a financial reward for his or her classification accuracy. Other- regarding incentives mean that another (passive) participant receives a financial reward for an advisee’s accuracy. This intends to capture consequential spillovers of one’s decision on other people as is the case when physicians make decisions affecting patients. It is to be expected that tasks with self-regarding incentives are relatively more likely to be primarily interpreted as epistemic tasks by the advisee because perfor - mance failures “only” lead to one’s own financial loss. Vice versa, it is to be expected that tasks with other-regarding incentives are relatively more likely to be primarily interpreted as ethical tasks by the advisee because failures lead to another person’s financial harm. In this exper - imental setup, the hypothesis could then be that advisees’ reliance in MLDSS is stronger in treatments with other-regarding incentives than with self-regarding incentives because in the former decision-makers have a more intensive desire to shift responsibility to and hide behind the MLDSS. It is important to note that the cooperation between advisee and MLDSS does not happen in an abstract setting but is to be studied in a concrete context of decision-making. The manipulation of a task as being perceived as primarily epistemic or primarily ethical is therefore likely to interact with the mode of XAI used to justify the advice. Studying the emerging interaction effects is crucial for an empirically informed J. Ammeling et al.

{"page_content": "human-centered design approach. In this context, it seems particularly worthwhile to systematically study how the use of methods from XAI in advice-giving influences a participant’s perception of owning one’s de - cision after receiving advice or not. One may hypothesize that receiving an explanation for a given advice makes it more likely that an advisee feels that the advice has truly persuaded him or her and that it is therefore more considered to be integrated in the advisee’s decision. In case of a wrong diagnosis, an advisee may then feel more responsible than in a case where the advice was absorbed in a more unreflected way and where he or she feels rather manipulated. 3.3. Example 2: The Perception of Manipulative vs. Persuasive AI Manipulation is a concept that is at the core of philosophical ethics [ 96 ]. It seems valuable to operationalize this abstract discussion to make it fruitful for a holistic empirical investigation of what a manipulation-free human-AI interaction could look like. Operationali - zation will have to be done jointly by behaviorists and computer sci - entists who will need ethicists’ guidance to navigate through the complex ethical debate on manipulation and boil it down to its key ideas. Ethicists, on the other hand, will need their empirically oriented colleagues to help them translate their conceptual notions in specific research design choices. The concepts of manipulative vs. persuasive AI [ 97, 98 ] may therefore serve as another useful illustration of interdisci - plinary collaboration. From an ethical perspective, it might be consid - ered important that physicians are not subconsciously nudged into following the advice of an MLDSS because this would undermine their autonomy as decision-makers. If nudging occurs, they are only nomi - nally kept in the loop of decision-making, but their role is factually reduced to the role of vicarious agents of the technical system (see, for instance, Ref. [ 99 ]). Generating faithful explanations that are provided to substantiate an MLDSS’s advice to convince the advisee to follow it seems ethically more desirable than generating explanations that are behaviorally most successful in inducing follower behavior. The next paragraphs may help to illustrate how a holistic and interdisciplinary collaboration between ethicists, behaviorists and computer scientists could look like in this context. Ethicists disagree to a substantial degree about the identification question of what makes advice manipulative. For instance, some phi - losophers argue that manipulation should be characterized by the in - tentions of the manipulator. The Trickery Account of manipulation argues that it is characterized by a deliberate attempt to induce faulty beliefs in a person to make him or her act in the way desired by the manipulator [ 100 ]. Klenk [ 101 ], however, argues for an Indifference Account where manipulation is not necessarily caused by deceptive in - tentions but by a manipulators’ indifference to the means with which he or she achieves her goal to influence the decision-maker. This latter approach seems better suited for the concept of “manipulative AI” as the MLDSS will by definition be lacking intentions to deceive and thus be indifferent to the means it uses. It should be noted that this discussion is not only of academic interest as policy makers are increasingly keen of banning AI systems that manipulate people’s decisions or exploit their vulnerabilities (EU AI Act, Article 5). It seems important to explicitly consider the intuitions of the potentially manipulated decision-makers and those affected by their choices to understand whether an explanation is interpreted as faithful or manipulative. It is therefore crucial to address this question in behaviorally designed experiments. To do so, it seems necessary to explicitly contrast participants’ perception of an advice when receiving it from a human that provides certain explanations with an advice that is provided by MLDSS that provide certain explanations. This comparison may help to disentangle between the above cited Trickery and Indif - ference Account and their relevance for the actual perception of human- AI interaction and their behavioral implications. It is unlikely that be - haviorists and XAI researchers will be able to design adequate experi - mental setups to capture this distinction without closely collaborating with ethicists. Analogously, will XAI researchers naturally focus on different kinds of questions that are more closely related to the questions that are at the core of their domain than ethicists or social scientists. Nauta et al. [ 102 ], for instance, focus on the alignment of explainable image classifiers with medical classification standards and the possibility of human decision-makers to manually correct the system’s reasoning. It would be fascinating to expand their research by studying whether the possibility to correct reasoning increases an advisees’ perception of owning a de - cision. Kulesza et al. [ 18 ], for instance, focus on Explanatory Debugging Cycles of Explanation and find that users using these cycles understood the learning system better and expressed a preference for them.", "metadata": {"producer": "Acrobat Distiller 8.1.0 (Windows)", "creator": "Elsevier", "creationdate": "2025-04-26T10:33:58+00:00", "crossmarkdomains[1]": "elsevier.com", "crossmarkmajorversiondate": "2010-04-23", "creationdate--text": "26th April 2025", "elsevierwebpdfspecifications": "7.0.1", "robots": "noindex", "moddate": "2025-04-26T10:46:11+00:00", "author": "Jonas Ammeling", "doi": "10.1016/j.techsoc.2024.102791", "title": "An interdisciplinary perspective on AI-supported decision making in medicine", "keywords": "Machine learning,Decision-support system,Human-machine interaction,Medical image diagnosis,Ethically aligned design,Value-based design", "subject": "Technology in Society, 81 (2025) 102791. doi:10.1016/j.techsoc.2024.102791", "crossmarkdomains[2]": "sciencedirect.com", "crossmarkdomainexclusive": "true", "source": "data\\An-interdisciplinary-perspective-on-AI-supported-decisi_2025_Technology-in-S.pdf", "total_pages": 10, "page": 7, "page_label": "8", "start_index": 0}}

Their research design, however, does not test for ethically relevant charac - teristics like a potential divergence in people’s keenness for explanatory cycles in ethical tasks as opposed to epistemic ones. Furthermore, the explicit elicitation of the impact of the explanation on subjective feelings of being manipulated and whether this perception differs between the recipients of the advice and those who observe the influence from the outside is not considered. Establishing such a gap, however, may be very relevant for a policy debate that often relies on the identification criteria of outside observers like politicians or lawyers. It is unlikely that such a question would be addressed without a profound knowledge of the philosophical manipulation debate that behaviorists and XAI specialists are unlikely to have. Similarly, previous research that sought to address real-world users instead of outsider observers has relied on qualitative interviews with UX specialists to create user-centered AI [ 103 ]. This is doubtlessly important. It seems, however, important to complement this research by quantitative studies that systematically investigate the intuitions of affected users, as designers might wrongly project their own intuitions on others. Here, we take up a call from Miller [ 104 ] who already argued that most work in XAI tends to take up researchers’ intuitions of what constitutes an explanation instead of relying on expertise from other disciplines how people define and evaluate explanations. This un - derlines that the implementation and implication of an ethical concept like “persuasion instead of manipulation” has to be tested using behavioral methods with real users in the context of concrete techno - logical solutions. This may necessitate manipulations that compare perceptions of human advice versus AI-based advice, experiencing and observing influence or performing for oneself or others. These are manipulations from social science research that are typi - cally and understandably out of the scope of more technically oriented XAI researchers. The use of XAI has profound ethical implications that need to be studied holistically. Specific manipulations and experimental manipu - lations that happen at the behavioral level within concrete interaction designs will naturally not arise from behavioral or technical research questions that are often based on the intention to increase performance. This is natural because different perspectives tend to focus on different questions. The diversity of these different foci leads to a more holistic consideration of AI-based decision-making in medicine. This requires the working together of experts from all three disciplines on joint research designs. 4. Conclusion In a seminal paper, Rahwan et al. [ 105 ] draw attention to the need for cross-disciplinary scientific collaboration to examine how intelligent machines affect humans and vice versa. Medicine is one area where, due to numerous advances in automatic processing and interpretation of data, AI-based decision support systems are already making their way into everyday practice. The use of AI-based systems will continue to increase significantly in the near future in this area. Given its societal relevance, medicine therefore represents a use case where the need for cross-disciplinary research is particularly urgent. In this paper, we have focused on three perspectives that seem to us J. Ammeling et al.

The main barriers to the use of digital technologies are related to economic aspects, complexity and unsuitability of equipment. The creation of networks or collaborations between the actors involved to share equipment, costs, exchange knowledge, as well as governmental financial support were considered the main drivers of digital technologies for organic and agroecological systems. The results of this study contribute to theorising on the diffusion of innovations and may be helpful for policy makers and farm advisors as it provides relevant and important information to define and incorporate solid approaches to digital transformation in an agroecology innovation ecosystem. 1. Introduction Digital technologies (DTs) have become great allies of agricultural systems by providing solutions to increase production through more efficient and sustainable practices [1–4]. DTs are used mainly in preci- sion or large-scale conventional farming [5–8] to optimize inputs and resources, improve product quality, reduce workload and environ- mental impacts, among others [9–11]. Despite this potential of DTs there are still some questions about the real benefits, as well as the risks, limitations and/or consequences of the digitalisation of agricultural production systems [12–15], especially those with a more sustainable approach [12,16–19]. The European Union recognizes the potential of DTs to contribute to the environmental and socioeconomic sustainability of agricultural systems [20,21], therefore, the promotion of knowledge, innovation and digitalisation is one of the actions prioritised in the CAP Strategic Plan (2023–2027). This strategy emphasizes both the need to invest in technologies and the creation of an enabling environment that will help farmers adopt and effectively use digital technologies [21,22]. However, the digitalisation strategies for agriculture and rural areas of the member states include limited considerations on DTs as tools to achieve envi- ronmental, climate and rural objectives [21]. While the EU views ag- roecology and digitalisation as \"essential\" for achieving the goals of the \"Farm to Fork\" and \"Green Deal\" [16], this approach may pose challenges and controversies due to potential misalignments between current DTs and agroecological principles. Agroecological production systems, as opposed to conventional ones, focuses on socioeconomic sustainability and environmental conserva- tion, by integrating ecological principles in locally adapted farming practices [16,23,24]. Although nowadays many digital tools can be used in organic and agroecological systems (see section 2.1) [25–29], their focus on prioritizing economic efficiency and the few and/or real con- tributions to addressing social and environmental challenges is still questioned [30–35]. This means that the capacity of DTs to effectively support agroecology is not clearly demonstrated and continues to pose significant challenges [19]. Due to the wide diversity of agroecology criteria (13 agroecological principles) [36], it is suggested that their compatibility with digitalisation depends on multiple factors, including the type of user, the adaptive capacity, the purpose for which digital tools are integrated and/or mobilised in these systems, among others [16,25,27,37]. The use/adoption of DTs in precision and conventional agricultural systems has been extensively studied [34,38–42], however, it seems that the adoption rate is still low and fragmented [4,43]. Osrof et al. [4], provide a comprehensive overview of the main factors (individual, organisational, technological and external) affecting the adoption of DTs. These authors point out that most research has focused on farmers, so there is a gap in the multi-stakeholder understanding of the factors influencing the adoption of DTs. Barriers and drivers for the adoption of DTs may also vary according to country cultures, although a low per- centage of existing studies have had a cross-country focus. There is therefore a need to fill this gap with more cross-country studies [4]. In contrast, studies on the digitalisation of agroecological systems are still scarce. Previous literature has mentioned, some factors that might in- fluence farmers’ decisions to adopt or reject DTs in organic and/or ag- roecological systems [16,29,39,44,45]. However, there is no comprehensive study that analyses the differing reasons for non-adoption of DTs and that identifies the main barriers, risks and drivers in such systems. Furthermore, most of the available research has focused on specific contexts, leaving significant gaps in the overall un- derstanding of this topic. Stakeholders’ perception of the direct and indirect benefits of using DTs in farming systems is a key factor influencing the willingness to adopt them [4]. Schnebelin et al.

[46], analysed the perception of key representatives of conventional farming, organic farming and digital organisations on digital development in French agriculture. However, to the authors’ knowledge, there is no study that analyses this multi-stakeholder perception in agroecological production systems within a broad cross-European context. Schnebelin et al. [46], highlight the need for further research on farmers’ uses of technologies and for functional and multi-stakeholder analyses to identify mechanisms to reduce barriers and encourage incentives. Furthermore, Bellon-Maurel et al. [47], suggest that future analyses on key aspects of digitalisation in agroecology should have a multi-stakeholder and participatory approach. Some research includes reflections on barriers, risks and drivers of digitalisation in organic and/or agroecological systems [16,25,27,46, 48]. However, none of these studies analyse these aspects together using primary information and from a multi-stakeholder approach. Organic farming and agroecology have common objectives, principles and drivers. In Europe, most agroecological practices are applied by organic farmers [16]. Despite this, there are no known previous studies that analyse digitalisation jointly in these two types of production systems. Accordingly, the purpose of this study is to analyse the perception of farmers, farm advisors and producer organisations and/or associations and/or cooperatives (collectively, POs/PAs/Coops) on the use of DTs in organic and agroecological production systems in different European countries. In particular this study investigates the research questions (RQ): RQ1: What are the perceptions of farmers, farm advisors and POs/ PAs/Coops on the benefits of digitalisation of organic and agroeco- logical systems and the differences between the approaches of the three stakeholders? RQ2: What are the main reasons for farmers not to use DTs in organic and agroecological production systems? RQ3: What perceptions do farmers, farm advisors and POs/PAs/ Coops have about the barriers, risks and drivers of using DTs in organic and agroecological production and the differences between the approaches of the three stakeholders? This study is novel in that it jointly addresses key aspects of digi- talisation from the approach of three of the main stakeholders in organic and agroecological production systems in several European countries. The results will provide relevant information for all actors involved in these production systems, technology developers and providers, orga- nisations, research centres and policy makers, who will be able to identify the aspects that need to be strengthened in relation to the strategies, regulatory frameworks and/or polices necessary to guarantee an effective synergy between DTs and organic and/or agroecological systems.

In this study digital technologies relate to information technologies and operational technologies. Infor- mation technologies refer to the electronic tools, devices, systems and/ or resources used for the creation, processing, transmission, and storage of data, while operational technologies facilitate the management, monitoring, supervision, and control of industrial operations, focusing on the physical devices and processes they use. This definition was taken from the classification of digital technologies under the European proj- ect, SmartAgriHubs [49]. 2. Theoretical background 2.1. Use of digital technologies in organic and/or agroecological production systems There is a wide variety of DTs that can be applied to facilitate the implementation of the principles of agroecological production systems [25–29]. While Ditzler and Driessen [50] showed the potential of robots in agroecological crop production, they stress that automation in agro- ecology requires a wide diversity of approaches and actors in order to be in line with the principles of this type of sustainable production system. Paget et al. [48], analysed in a more specific context several existing digital solutions that can contribute to the transition towards agro- ecology, mainly tools for data collection, decision support, and plat- forms for knowledge exchange and sharing (drones, satellites, web/social media applications and smartphones). Their main findings highlight the challenges of innovation to adapt to the characteristics of agroecological systems. Ajena et al. [16], present a case study on how Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) can support farmer-driven research on agroecological transitions. They point out that it is key to identify technological proposals that promote agroecological and organic prin- ciples, support a transformation agenda and are consciously applied according to the conditions and needs of the communities. Tassin [51], shows how digital tools (social media) in China support new young in- termediaries who are returning to the land in the promotion of agro- ecological practice and support the re-emergence of peasant supply chains. At the same time, this author calls attention to the digital inter-knowledge relationships that can shape agroecological circles exclusively for producers who are qualified to belong to them. Agroecological processes are dynamic and complex, which is re- flected by both Gascuel-Odoux et al. [52], and Bellon Maurel et al. [19], studies suggesting that new technologies (high-resolution remote detection, sensors and mapping tools) can contribute to the acquisition and use of data needed to monitor and characterise the trajectories of the main biological processes and create models of complex mechanisms within agroecology. Ewert et al. [27], Ajena et al. [16], and Bellon Maurel and Huyghe [25], emphasise the potential of DTs and their important role as enablers of agroecological transformation. Despite this Ewert et al. [27], stress that there are still critical points and issues that need to be resolved, such as data ownership and the increasing use of non-renewable resources. They also highlight the need for more sys- tematic evaluations to obtain more evidence at different scales and in other farming systems. 2.2. Perceptions and attitudes on the use/adoption of digital technologies in farming systems Multiple factors (social, economic, cultural, institutional and/or political) may influence farmers’ perceptions and attitudes towards DTs [53–56]. According to Smidt and Jokonya [55], farmers’ perceptions of technology adoption change over time according to new and emerging technologies. Many studies emphasise that factors such as farmer characteristics, socio-demographics, skills, knowledge, and perceived attributes of the technology, among other aspects, influence farmers’ decisions to adopt DTs [4,20,39,42,45,53]. According to Bontsa et al. [56], perceptions of DTs could be a barrier to their adoption, depending on the approach. These authors found that small farmers engaged in cattle raising had a more positive perception of the use of DTs than those dedicated to sheep and goat raising. Among the main factors affecting this perception were age, education level, employment status, income and being part of a cooperative. Cavallo et al. [6,7], identified different opinions and attitudes on tractor technology innovations among Italian farmers. Factors such as age, level of education, farm size, income, suitability and cost of tractors and level of concern for environmental issues make the difference between those willing and those unwilling to adopt tractors with innovative technologies.

Factors such as age, level of education, farm size, income, suitability and cost of tractors and level of concern for environmental issues make the difference between those willing and those unwilling to adopt tractors with innovative technologies. Bellon Maurel et al. [19], raises the issue of the divide between large farms that are likely to adopt robots and smaller (non-conventional) farms that are not adopting them or are slow to adopt them. The authors mention that it is important to find innovative solutions that combine a \"high-low tech\" approach. Earlier studies show that stakeholders in conventional or organic food production systems recognise the potential of new DTs, as well as the opportunities and advantages they can bring them [46,57]. A multi-stakeholder study that assessed the views of Brazilian dairy farmers, advisors and citizens on the characteristics of an ideal farm found that all three stakeholder groups consider that tech- nology plays an important role in dairy farms. However, it highlights that the justifications for this view differ between the groups, possibly because of their individual values and interests [57]. Differences in views can also emerge from a different awareness of existing DTs, their use and benefits between the different stakeholders. Schnebelin et al. [46], through interviews and the use of a multi-stakeholder approach analysed how digitalisation is seen in French organic systems, specifically focusing on perceptions of digital- isation, its impacts and potential. The results show that organic and conventional actors do not perceive the same benefits and risks of using DTs and therefore do not implement the same innovation processes. Ajena et al. [16], analysed the perception and knowledge of Swiss organic farmers on the use of DTs. The results show a division between the opinions of \"Artisanal Organic\" and \"Digital Organic\" farmers mainly with regard to the amount and type of tools and/or equipment suitable for use in their organic production systems. In relation to the aspects mentioned above, Rogers’ diffusion of in- novations theory states that the perception of certain attributes of in- novations by potential adopters is the main influence on adoption decisions [58]. According to this theory, there are 5 attributes that determine people’s adoption of innovations: relative advantage, compatibility, complexity, testability and observability [59,60]. This theory also defines five stages of the innovation decision process: awareness, interest, evaluation, trial and adoption [60]. This theory has been widely used to analyse the factors that influence the rate of diffusion and adoption of practices and technologies in agriculture [58, 61,62]. The approaches of this theory are relevant for the analysis of certain results of our study, and accordingly in section 5 ‘discussion’ we reflect on some of them in more detail. 2.3. Barriers, risks and drivers for the use/adoption of digital technologies in farming systems Comprehensive analyses of the factors affecting or limiting the adoption of DTs in precision and conventional large and small-scale production systems are a baseline for analysing these aspects in sus- tainable production systems. Osrof et al. [4], provides a comprehensive list of barriers and drivers for the adoption of Smart Farming Technol- ogies (SFTs). Ferrari et al. [63], contributes significant insights on the barriers, drivers and impacts of ICTs use in rural areas from the point of view of interdisciplinary experts. The barriers identified mainly in conventional production systems, related to technological, socioeco- nomic, institutional, behavioral, psychological and other factors, served C.

The high cost of acquisition, operation and maintenance of the DTs, the complexity of their use, the lack of awareness and knowledge of farmers on DTs, among others that are detailed in Table 1, stand out as the main barriers. Similarly, these barriers have been identified in a more dis- aggregated manner in studies with organic and/or agroecological sys- tems approaches, some of them under specific contexts. Bellon Maurel and Huyghe [25], Ajena et al. [16] and Paget et al. [48], agree that the main barriers are associated with socio-economic aspects (high invest- ment costs and complexity of using DTs). However, as shown in Tables 1 and in this type of production system, additional barriers associated with the lack of suitability of digital technologies to support the imple- mentation of organic or agroecological practices arise, mainly due to the lack of interaction between the designers of the DTs and the users. Osrof et al. [4], classified the drivers of SFTs adoption into individ- ual, organisational, technological and external factors. According to experts, the main drivers for the use of ICT in rural areas are economic (cost reduction) and regulatory (strict production monitoring) [63]. As indicated in Table 1, the reduction of the cost of using technology and access to financing programs (subsidies) have been identified also as key aspects to boost the use of DTs in production systems. In general, the main risks associated with the use of DTs in production systems are technology dependence and the exclusion of some actors, with certain limitations to deal with the changes demanded by DTs, for example, small farmers and those with a low level of education and/or limited knowledge. 3. Research methodology For this study, surveys were conducted among farmers, farm advisors and POs/PAs/Coops of organic and agroecological production systems in 10 European countries. 3.1. Sample and data Data were collected from three key stakeholders: farmers as users of DTs; farm advisors as informants, trainers and/or facilitators for the implementation of DTs; and POs/APs/Coops with their dual role as users and/or facilitators and intermediaries between technology providers and farmers. The survey was distributed by the partners of the EU project “PATH2DEA” to the targeted groups of stakeholders, between June and September 2023, inclusive. In our study, we employed a combination of convenience sampling and snowball sampling methods to select participants. Convenience sampling is a non-probability method based on criteria of closeness and easy access to the popula- tion [66]. We initially recruited participants based on the information available in the databases of the partners involved in the EU project ‘PATH2DEA’. This method was chosen due to the availability of participants. Following initial recruitment, participants were asked to refer others who met the study criteria (i.e., either farmers, farm advisors or POs/ PAs/Coops of organic and/or agroecological production systems located in the 10 European countries). This approach was particularly useful for expanding the sample of respondents beyond the databases of the partners of the EU project. The survey link was also distributed via newsletters on the main project website and partner websites, articles in farmers’ magazines, and social media messages. The survey was distributed mainly in the following countries: Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Spain, Slovakia, Switzerland. In some of these countries the survey was also distributed on paper to the par- ticipants during events that were carried out by the project partners. While the potential for bias exists with the use of convenience and snowball sampling methods [66,67], some actions were taken to miti- gate these biases and ensure a more representative sample. First, we utilized databases from multiple partners involved in the EU project ’PATH2DEA’, each of whom had access to a wide array of participants.

This guidance aimed to broaden the range of participants beyond those who might be most immediately accessible or familiar. A total of 533 surveys were completed by stakeholders. 3.2. Survey design The questionnaires were designed in LimeSurvey and translated into 9 languages. They were reviewed and validated by native speakers familiar with agroecological and organic agriculture so as to ensure accuracy and understandability. The three questionnaires were struc- tured in sections, as follows: 1. Stakeholder characterisation, with gen- eral information on the three types of stakeholders; 2. General aspects of the use of DTs, including questions on perceptions of DTs; and 3. Iden- tification of barriers, drivers and risks in the use of DTs, with specific variables on these three aspects. Each section included different response options: 1. Closed or fixed-response, \"yes-no\"; 2. Multiple choice response: Range of responses with an open-ended item at the end of the list (other-which?); and 3. Scale responses: alternative responses graded in intensity (5-point Likert-type scale). Most of the studies described in Section 2, especially those listed in Table 1, were used to define the response options and statements included in the scaling questions. The questionnaires were reviewed by multi-actor project partners to ensure optimal user understanding. 3.3. Data analysis The data obtained from these surveys, using only those completely filled out, were analysed using two statistical techniques with SPSS software (version 29.0): a One-Way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and Pearson ’ s Chi-square Test to determine if there are significant differ- ences between the responses of the stakeholder groups. For both tests, significant differences between group responses are considered to exist if p is ≤ 0.05. Other studies have used these techniques to assess prefer- ences and compare the perceptions of different actors ’ groups [ 34, 68 ]. To account for the variability of other effects and avoid issues related to non-independence of data in ANOVA, an additional factor (specifically a nested factor) was incorporated into the analysis: country of origin of the surveyed. 4. Results 4.1. General characteristics of the sample and stakeholders ’ profile Of the total number of surveys obtained (533), the largest number (308) are from farmers (58 %), followed by advisors with 170 surveys (32 %) and 55 surveys were completed by POs/PAs/Coops (10 %). Seventy seven percent of the farmers surveyed are natural persons and 21 % are constituted as companies. The main sector in which the farmers are active is vegetables (43 %), followed by arable farming (35 %) and animal production (26 %). The majority of farmers (39 %) have a cultivated area of less than 2 ha and produce under organic (78 % of farmers) and agroecological systems (32 %). Thirty-three percent of the advisors surveyed are natural persons, 31 % are advisors to POs/PAs/ Coops, 15 % belong to a private company and 12 % are from a public entity. More than half of the advisors surveyed provide technical support pre- and post-harvest (55 %). The services provided by the advisors are agronomic analysis and interpretation services (54 %) and advice on integrated farm management (49 %). The vast majority (81 %) of the advisors provide their services to organic production systems and 61 % advise agroecological production systems. Twenty-five of the POs/PAs/ Coops surveyed are cooperatives, ten are producer organisations and ten are producer associations. The majority of POs/PAs/Coops work within the arable farming sector. Of the majority of these stakeholders (51 %) work in the fruit sector while 35 % work in the animal production sector. The majority of POs and PAs (80 %) produce under organic production systems. Seventy-six percent of the cooperatives produce under agro- ecological systems. 4.2.

The analysis of means for each statement (the highest), for the three stakeholder groups, indicates that the three main benefits of the use of DTs in organic and/or agroecological farming are: 1.

Offers more opportunities to advance the transition towards more sustainable production systems (mean value 3.66). Although these three benefits mentioned above have been prioritised as shown in Table 3, the results of the ANOVA analysis indicate that there are significant differences between stakeholder group perceptions for most of the statements (five out of seven). For example, advisors and POs/PAs/Coops compared to farmers are more likely to agree that DTs facilitate communication, interaction and exchange of knowledge and/ or experiences between actors involved in organic and/or agroecologi- cal systems BDT2 ( F = 11.200; p = < 0.001). The same trend of greater agreement between these two groups (advisors and POs/PAs/Coops) is observed for the other two prioritised benefits, BDT01 - o ffers more opportunities to advance the transition to- wards more sustainable production systems ( F = 4.936; p = < 0.008) and BDT03 - facilitates and/or enhances strategic farm design, operational management and decision support ( F = 5.475; p = < 0.004). For the variables BDT5 ( F = 1.178; p = 0.309) and BDT7 ( F = 2.491; p = 0.084) there is greater agreement (no significant differences) between the 3 groups. This means that all three stakeholders agree that the use of DTs supports and/or facilitates the application of organic and/or agroeco- logical farming practices/principles and that it also reduces costs due to the optimisation of inputs and the reduction of the use of natural resources. 4.3.

{"page_content": "Technology in Society 81 (2025) 102763 6 three main reasons given by farmers for not using DTs are: 1. I am not aware of relevant existing DTs (37 %). 2. Existing DTs are not adapted to the scale of my production system (33 %) and 3. It is too expensive to acquire this type of DTs (27 %). Lack of sufficient/necessary resources to invest in DTs (25 %) and lack of knowledge/capacity needed for the operation of DTs (22 %) were also other reasons given by farmers. The complete list of reasons and prioritization percentages can be found in fig. 1 ( Appendix A ). Forty-two percent of the surveyed farmers who do not make use of digital tools are small-scale farmers, i.e. they produce on land of less than 2 ha and 22 % on areas between 2 and 10 ha. 4.4. Main barriers to the use of digital technologies in organic and/or agroecology farming The three main barriers to digitalisation in organic and/or agro- ecological production systems are: 1. High investment costs for the pur- chase, operation and maintenance of equipment (58.2 %). 2. Complexity in the use of equipment/software and in the processing and/or analysis of data, which requires specific knowledge and time-expensive training (50.1 %) and 3. Most DTs are designed for industrial-scale production farms and are not suitable for small-scale farmers (46.5 %). fig. 2 ( Appendix A ) describes the full list of barriers that were analysed. In spite of this prioritization, the results of the Chi-square analysis ( Table 4 ) show that there are significant differences in most of the re- sponses from different stakeholders (seven out of nine). For example, for the first prioritised barrier ( High investment costs for the purchase, oper- ation and maintenance of equipment ) ( x 2 = 7.763; p = 0.021), POs/PAs/ Coops and farmers are in greater agreement that high investment costs are a barrier to the adoption of DTs. The advisors agree the most with the second prioritised barrier ( Complexity in the use of equipment/software and in the processing and/or analysis of data) ( x 2 = 20.394; p = < 0.001), followed by the POs/PAs/Coops. There are no significant differences in the responses for the third prioritised barrier ( x 2 = 5.043; p = 0.080), this means that all three stakeholder groups agree that most DTs are designed for industrial-scale production farms and are not suitable for small- scale farmers. 4.5. Main risks of the use of digital technologies in organic and/or agroecology farming All stakeholders agreed that the three main risks of using DTs are: 1. Dependence on companies for operation/maintenance/repair of equipment and/or data management (52.9 %), 2. Exclusion of small farmers due to low investment (52.9 %) and 3. Exclusion of farmers due to lack of knowledge and/or skills (51.6 %). The complete list of risks that were analysed can be found in fig. 3 ( Appendix A ). There are significant differences in the majority (six out of ten) of answers given by the three groups. However, Table 5 shows that there are no significant differences between the groups ’ responses for two of the three prioritised risks RI1 ( x 2 = 0.685; p = 0.710) and RI10 ( x 2 = 5.155; p = 0.076). This means, all three stakeholders agree that dependence on companies for the operation and/or maintenance/repair of equipment and the exclusion of farmers due to lack of knowledge and/or skills are risks involved in digitalisation processes. Regarding the exclusion of farmers due to low investment capacity RI8 ( x 2 = 16.193; p = < 0.001), it is the POs/PAs/Coops who perceive this risk the most. 4.6. Main drivers to digitalisation in organic and/or agroecology farming The primary drivers of digitalisation in organic and/or agroecolog- ical farming are: 1. The creation of networks or collaborations between cooperatives, farming communities and advisors to share equipment, costs, facilitate relationships between stakeholders, exchange knowledge and improve training (mean value: 3.85), 2.

In this survey, representation was heterogeneous between European countries. However, according to the results of the ANOVA ( Tables 3 and 7 ) anal ysis, the country factor did not significantly influence the results. 5. Discussion 5.1. RQ1: What are the perceptions of farmers, farm advisors and POs/PAs/Coops on the benefits of digitalisation of organic and/or ag- roecological systems and the differences between the approaches of the 3 stakeholders? Co-creation and sharing of knowledge is one of the principles of agroecology [ 69 ]. Ajena et al. [ 16 ], stress that the interactive potential of DTs and digital networks can promote and enhance different ways of communication between farmers and experts (bottom-up, top-down, and peer-to-peer). Through the use of technological platforms, pro- cesses of knowledge co-creation and interaction among multiple actors can be fostered. The results of our study indicate that the farmers, farm advisors and POs/PAs/Coops surveyed recognise this potential of the DTs to improve and facilitate communication, exchange of knowledge and experiences among the actors that are part of their organic and/or agroecological production systems. Our results are in line with the findings of Schnebelin et al. [ 46 ], and Schnebelin [ 44 ], regarding the relevance given by French Agricultural Innovation System actors (mainly those related to organic agriculture) to DTs as tools to create and exchange knowledge. This is mainly because these organic stakeholders see digitalisation as a way of developing knowledge. Thus, the results herein seem to reinforce this conclusion [ 44 ]. The responses of the POs/PAs/Coops surveyed are an indicator of the relevance of DTs in the processes of interaction and communication among the actors that are part of these organisations. This finding co- incides with the observations of Schnebelin et al. [ 46 ], and Rijswijk et al. [ 70 ], who point out that agricultural organisations and cooperatives are more inclined to use technologies due to the benefits they obtain within their structure. Most of the DTs that are promoted or developed by organic organisations are related to knowledge management and knowledge exchange [ 46 ]. Rijswijk et al. [ 70 ], also highlight that the technologies that are developed by agricultural cooperatives in collaboration with digital companies are mostly applications to organise and consolidate infor- mation so that it is accessible to farmers and supports their farm man- agement operations. This perhaps also explains why there is greater agreement, especially from POs/PAs/Coops that the DTs facilitate and/or improve strategic farm design, operational management and decision support. Schnebelin et al. [ 46 ], also found that all stakeholders interviewed (conventional and organic) agreed on the potential of dig- italisation in improving working conditions, practices and risks. Simi- larly, as pointed out by these authors in their study, our results show that these stakeholders, but especially the POs/PAs/Coops, see DTs as op- portunities to advance the transition towards more sustainable pro- duction systems.

[ 25 ], that DTs are a set of resources that, when mobilised together with other resources, allow sustainable agricultural production objectives to be achieved. Our results confirm the claims of Schnebelin et al. [ 46 ], regarding the important role of advisory services and POs/PAs/Coops as in- termediaries in the digitalisation process. In addition to supporting the DTs adoption process, POs/PAs/Coops are key in processes where trust is elemental, such as in the implementation of technologies and data management. The findings of our study show that farm advisors and POs/PAs/Coops, compared to farmers, have a better perception and more agreement on the benefits offered by the DTs. This supports the findings of Schnebelin et al. [ 46 ], that perceptions of the use of DTs in production systems vary according to the type of actor. In fact, as Ajena et al. [ 16 ], and Cavallo et al. [ 6, 7 ], demonstrated, these perceptions may even differ among farmers themselves. According to Cardoso et al. [ 57 ], the differences between these stakeholders perceptions are related to their individual values and interests. Our results also lead us to reflect on Roger ’ s theory, mainly on the five characteristics that determine how users respond to new in- novations ( relative advantage; compatibility; complexity; trialability; and observability ) [ 60 ]. According to Montes de Oca Munguia et al. [ 58 ], it is key that stakeholders understand the potential benefits of DTs relative to the existing technology or practice that would be replaced, in order to more accurately measure the relative advantage of an alternative. Cavallo et al. [ 7 ], identified that one of the characteristics of farmers who were more willing to adopt innovative tractors were those who were culturally developed and well documented about the benefits of tractor innovations. This leads us to suggest that farm advisors and POs/PAs/Coops are more aware or have a greater knowledge of the benefits and/or advantages of using DTs, thus giving them a more pos- itive perception of their use. Based on the results, we suggest that farm advisors and POs/PAs/ Coops recognise the benefits of DTs because they perceive more relative advantages of using DTs. In addition, perhaps these two stakeholders, unlike farmers, have had more possibilities to know firsthand positive results of experiments with DTs in organics or agroecology production systems or are possibly linked to farms that use them ( trialability and observability). Therefore, as observed by Mbatha ’ s [ 60 ], POs/- PAs/Coops, farm advisors, governments and other actors involved and/or interested in digitalisation should be aware of how potential Table 4 Chi-square independence test between the type of stakeholder and the barriers, n = 533.

Toffolini & Jeuffroy [ 8 ] consider that the digitalisation of agriculture is closely linked to the evolution of on-farm experimentation. This form of experimentation facilitates the production of credible, relevant and legitimate data as it adopts a farmer-centred perspective. Perhaps then, experimentation with DTs in organic and/or agroecological production systems can be a good option to ensure feasibility and make the results visible to farmers. POs/PAs/Coops and advisory services, play a key role in showing the benefits of DTs to farmers and encouraging them to use them in their production systems [ 56 ]. As Cavallo [ 7 ] mentions, this knowledge about farmers ’ perceptions towards DTs is important for technology providers seeking new business opportunities, for research centres in defining their innovation programs and for governments that are responsible for agricultural policy regulations. 5.2. RQ2: What are the main reasons why farmers do not use DTs in organic and/or agroecological production systems? The main reason why the farmers surveyed do not use DTs is because they are not aware of them, which confirms the view of Qi et al. [ 53 ], who argue that farmers ’ awareness of an emerging technology influences their decision to adopt it in their production systems. In their studies, Smidt and Jokonya [ 55 ], and Osrof et al. [ 4 ], also acknowledge that one of the factors affecting digital adoption by farmers is the lack of awareness of the potential of using DTs to improve their farming prac- tices. Results from previous studies show similar trends. For example, the findings of Ajena et al. [ 16 ], reflect that the little awareness of autonomous machinery among Swiss organic farmers was the reason for low adoption rates. Zhou et al. [ 71 ], found that the percentage of farmers who are aware about technology is very low, i.e. their knowledge/understanding of the technological complexity is weak. They also demonstrated that there is a strong correlation between technology complexity/theoretical back- ground and technology use behaviour. It highlights that only when there is awareness and understanding of these technologies that a positive attitude of farmers towards their use emerges. Our results emphasise the need for awareness raising and training to encourage the use of DTs among smallholder farmers [ 16, 55 ]. Rogers ’ diffusion of innovations theory posits a five-step process that people go through when adopting something new: awareness, interest, evaluation, testing and adoption [ 60 ]. Our results reinforce this theory by showing that awareness about DTs is an essential step for their diffusion and subsequent adoption in organic and/or agroecological systems. This low level of awareness of existing DTs explains why farmers have a lower degree of perception of the relative advantages of their use. Forty-two percent of the surveyed farmers who do not make use of digital tools are small-scale farmers. To some extent, this explains why farmers consider that DTs are not adapted to the scale of their production systems. The above supports Rogers ’ s statement that innovations must meet the values, experiences and needs of the users ( compatibility is key) [ 60 ]. In this case we show that the incompatibility of the DTs has a significant negative impact on the degree of adoption by farmers. This response on the lack of compatibility could also justify the lower degree of agreement among farmers on the benefits of DTs. Takagi et al. [ 45 ], argue that organic farmers are more likely to adopt a new technology if it is compatible with their farm. Likewise, Osrof et al. [ 4 ], point out that farmers with small-scale operations are less likely to adopt smart farming technologies because they may not be suitable for their scale. Wittman et al. [ 65 ], highlight in their study that although there are some digital farming technologies designed for use by small-scale farmers, most of them have been marketed mainly for in- dustrial and large-scale farms. Cui and Wang [ 54 ] and Giua et al. [ 42 ], also point out that farmers with larger cultivated areas are more likely to use or try to adopt DTs. Ajena et al. [ 16 ], found that poultry and fruit producers are unable to experience far-reaching automation due to their limiting conditions such as their small size. In addition, the findings of Schnebelin [ 44 ], show that a large percentage of organic farmers consider that DTs are not or cannot be adapted to their production systems. Smidt and Jokonya [ 55 ], mention that studies conducted several years ago show that farmers did not adopt agricultural technologies due to the high cost of the technologies.

This is perhaps, as mentioned by these authors, the reason why there is a tendency for larger farms to adopt more agricultural technologies in their production processes. Small farmers often have low incomes that do not allow them to make DTs investments on their own [ 55 ]. This suggests that access to advisory services and belonging to a group of farmers such as a coop- erative or farmers ’ association, can increase uptake through collective action such as co-purchase, co-use, and co-maintenance of digital tools among neighboring farmers. Ajena et al. [ 16 ], also found that most of the Swiss organic farmers surveyed consider that investment costs increased by the use of DTs, not only because of the cost of the equipment, but also because of the costs of maintenance and updates. The results of Bontsa et al. [ 56 ], and Schne- belin et al. [ 46 ], show strong agreement among a high percentage of small-scale farmers and organic organisations that DTs are expensive compared to other agricultural technologies and require higher invest- ment. These authors stress the need to offer low-cost DTs to motivate their adoption by small-scale farmers [ 54 ]. Regarding this economic barrier, Smidt and Jokonya [ 55 ], state that farmers ’ perception of the cost-related constraints of the technologies has changed. They emphasise that farmers now recognise the need to adopt these technologies for economic and environmental benefits. Table 7 Results of ANOVA analysis.

{"page_content": "Technology in Society 81 (2025) 102763 11 However, the above reflections on the results of previous studies and the findings of this research confirm that the high cost of DTs remains the main barrier to their adoption. Even interdisciplinary experts on digi- talisation and agriculture of rural areas recognise this as one of the main barriers [63]. Complexity in the use of equipment/software and in the processing and/ or analysis of data was the second barriers mostly cited by farmers. Bellon Maurel and Huyghe [25], and Schnebelin et al. [46], also agree that the complexity of new technologies can discourage farmers from using them in their organic and/or agroecological production systems. This perception of complexity also explains the low degree of agreement of farmers on the benefits of using DTs. The third barrier prioritised by all stakeholders is related to one of the reasons for non-use of DTs by farmers, as mentioned above: the lack of suitability of DTs. All stakeholders consider that most DTs are designed for industrial-scale production farms and are not suitable for small-scale farmers. These results are also in line with the hypothesis confirmed by Schnebelin [44] on the strong link between DTs for production (mainly precision farming) and industrialisation. The author points out that these types of DTs favour and contribute to the consolidation of domi- nant industrial agricultural systems. These three main barriers identified by all stakeholders surveyed (farmers, farm advisor and POs/PAs/Coops) reinforce even more Rogers’ statements that compatibility and complexity are two key attri- butes that influence the rate of diffusion and adoption of an innovation. Analysing the reasons given by farmers for the non-adoption of DTs (section 5.2) with the barriers described here confirms that the high cost of use and the lack of suitability of DTs are the main issues that need to be overcome to advance the digitalisation of organic and/or agroecological systems. - Main risks of the use of digital technologies Our findings show that on the perception of risks associated with the use of DTs there are also significant differences among stakeholders. This is in line with the statement by Schnebelin et al. [46], that actors involved in organic and/or agroecological innovation systems have heterogeneous perceptions about the risks associated with the use of DTs. However, all stakeholders surveyed agree that dependency on companies for the operation, maintenance and/or repair of equipment and the exclusion of farmers due to lack of knowledge and/or skills are the most relevant risks involved in the digitalisation processes of organic and/or agroecological systems. According to the opinions of farmers and organic organisations, one of the main risks associated with the use of DTs is the possibility of becoming dependent on them, and on repair services, and therefore losing power and control. They also emphasised the risk associated with the exclusion of farmers due to lack of infrastructure, skills and the cost of equipment in the case of farmers who have economic problems. Exclusion of farmers due to lack of knowledge and/or skills was also one of the risks prioritised by the stakeholders surveyed. In keeping with this finding, Ciliberti et al., show how the adoption of robots and sensors can contribute to a digital divide among older, less educated and less skilled producers [74]. Regarding the risk of exclusion of farmers due to their low investment capacity, Ferrari et al. [63], also identified that one of the negative impacts of digitalisation of rural areas is the exclusion of small farmers who cannot afford to use these DTs. On this point, the High Level Panel of Experts on Food Security and Nutrition [26] pointed out that larger farmers may have better access to new technologies through government support and subsidies, which can generate disadvantages for small farmers who may even run the risk of having to abandon farming and lose their land. Therefore, from the agroecology approach and following the statement of Bontsa et al. [56], to reduce the digital divide between large and small farmers their characteristics, circumstances and needs should be considered as rele- vant criteria for the design and implementation of DTs. Gkisakis and Damianakis [29] emphasise that digitalisation in agriculture is not ex- pected to be one of the main drivers for the agroecological transition, nevertheless, it could potentially be compatible when a combination of user innovation processes and a commons-based peer production model is applied. - Main drivers for the use of digital technologies Schnebelin et al. [46], highlight the importance of the in- terconnections between knowledge and technologies. This means that digitalisation demands knowledge and in turn creates opportunities for the creation of new knowledge, so that the integration and collaboration of stakeholder networks is key to this objective.

This means that digitalisation demands knowledge and in turn creates opportunities for the creation of new knowledge, so that the integration and collaboration of stakeholder networks is key to this objective. Similarly, Bellon Maurel and Huyghe [25], conclude that one of the main levers for the adoption of DTs is the creation of farmer networks to foster knowledge transfer, the development of collective actions, the installation of shared equip- ment and the exchange of data (e.g. on weather, diseases, practices, and so on). In addition, they stress that interaction between farm machinery designers and farmers in agroecological systems is crucial. Similar drivers were also stressed in the study by Ajena et al., [16]. The authors suggest that among the fundamental aspects for agroeco- logical innovation are cost-sharing between cooperatives and farming communities, or exchange platforms to facilitate relations with others stakeholders. Also, the involvement of farmers in the design and training of DTs and the creation of financial incentives for the purchase of equipment were found important. Our results also ratify Paget et al. [48], claims regarding the importance of co-design of DTs between key actors in agroecological systems. In this way, it would be possible to develop suitable digital solutions, in line with the agroecology paradigm that fit the contexts, needs and economic conditions of farmers [50]. As Hilbeck et al. [69], and Cardoso et al. [57], state, the interests, priorities, needs and experiences of the stakeholders involved in farming systems are different and even more so in the case of organic and/or agroecological systems, which perhaps explains the differences in the perceptions of benefits, risks and barriers of the groups we have ana- lysed. It is essential then, as Schnebelin et al. [46], argue, to consider all these perceptions so that digital development also benefits organic and/or agroecological production systems. However, with regard to the drivers herein, there seems to be more unanimity and clarity from all stakeholders surveyed on the aspects that need to be prioritised in order for the DTs to become allies of organic and/or agroecological systems. This makes sense as these drivers seem to be focused on overcoming the constraints, barriers and/or risks that were prioritised earlier by stake- holders, mainly related to aspects of awareness/knowledge, costs and suitability of DTs. Some studies show positive results from the implementation of some of the actions/measures identified above as ‘drivers’, mainly the co- design of DTs and financial support. For example, Hilbeck et al. [69], present a case example of a smartphone application designed under the co-creation approach with agroecological smallholder farmers, to assist them in their record-keeping and research tasks. Kihoma et al. [75], illustrated that an evaluation of this tool (smartphone application) helped farmers to identify the most appropriate agroecological practices in their areas and contributed to increasing agroecological knowledge through information sharing. Similarly, with respect to government support, there is greater evidence in the case of conventional production systems that government subsidies can significantly increase farmers’ willingness to adopt DTs, especially in the case of smallholder farmers [54,56]. Bellon Maurel and Huyghe [25], also stress the importance of providing specific public subsidies for the purchase of agricultural ma- chinery for agroecology. Furthermore, Lioutas et al. [12], stress that there is a need to provide incentives for the production of low-cost digital tools compatible with small-scale farming and organic and ag- roecological production. Bellon-Maurel et al. [47], point out that DTs and agroecology are disruptive innovations that change the practices of actors and C.

All of the above barriers, risks and drivers identified, provide insights for the definition of key elements to be taken into account in the design and structuring of a solid and inte- grative agroecology innovation ecosystem that is enhanced through the effective use of the DTs. Some previous studies could serve as a basis for defining the design elements and principles necessary for the creation of this type of digital innovation ecosystems [ 76 – 78 ]. 6. Conclusions and implications This research provides significant insights to better understand key aspects of the digitalisation of organic and/or agroecological systems. 6.1. Theoretical implications • This study provides new evidence on the differences in stakeholders ’ perceptions of the use of DTs. Compared to farmers, POs/PAs/Coops and farm advisors are more aware of and/or more familiar with DTs and therefore agree more with the potential benefits of their use in organic and/or agroecological systems. Regarding barriers and risks, perceptions differ significantly among stakeholders, but there is a higher degree of agreement among farmers, farm advisors and POs/ PAs/Coops on strategies that would boost the use of DTs in organic and/or agroecological systems. • The findings confirm the claims of previous studies that the main barriers to the use of DTs are related to socio-economic and tech- nological aspects. Our results also support the assertion that the main risks are associated with dependence on companies and exclusion of farmers due to their socio-economic and/or cultural characteristics/ conditions. • The results support the findings of previous studies on the contri- bution of DTs in the implementation of the second principle of ag- roecology ‘Co-creation and sharing of knowledge ’. • Evidence is provided to show that: Stakeholder networks, co-design of DTs and governmental financial support are key aspects to take forward the digitalisation of organic and/or agroecological systems. Likewise, POs/PAs/Coops and farm advisors have a vital role in the processes of disseminating and improving knowledge/skills in the use of DTs in organic and/agroecological systems. • Our results on the adoption of digital technologies in organic and/or agroecological systems reinforce several statements of Rogers ’ diffusion of innovations theory on the five characteristics that determine users ’ response to new innovations and on the steps people take when adopting something new technologies. - Relative advantage: Knowledge and understanding of the potential benefits of DTs improves the perception of the advantages it can offer and this in turn could improve the degree of adoption. - Compatibility and complexity: The unsuitability of DTs, the complexity of their use and high cost are aspects that negatively affect adoption rates in organic and/or agroecological systems. - Trialability and observability: Further testing in real-life conditions and disseminating the results is key to providing farmers or other users of DTs in organic and/or agroecology with evidence of the performance of digital tools in this type of production systems. - Awareness as a first step: Improving the awareness of potential users of DTs is essential for their dissemination and subsequent adoption in organic and/or agroecological systems. 6.2. Implications and recommendations for managers and policy-makers This research has relevant implications for all stakeholders involved in organic and/or agroecological production systems (public and pri- vate) but especially for technology providers, farmers ’ organisations and/or cooperatives, research centres, and governments and public administrations. Firstly, the findings provide guidance on key issues related to the characteristics and operation of the DTs and on strategies that could improve their functioning. The results also provide important reflections on aspects to consider and/or strengthen in the programmes, regulatory framework and/or public policies on digitalisation and ag- roecology. In sum, this research represents key inputs to consider for the creation and/or strengthening of an agroecology innovation ecosystem that is enhanced by incorporating strong digital transformation ap- proaches. In this sense, the following should be considered: • Overcoming the economic barrier is a priority and requires greater attention to smallholder farmers, who seem to be the most affected. Collaboration between technology providers, researchers, advisors, POs/PAs/Coops and farmers is key to the co-design of new DTs that are adapted to the scale of small farms, support agroecological principles and have purchase, operation and maintenance costs that are accessible to all farmers. • Collaborative networks between farmers, POs/PAs/Coops and farm advisors, for collective action such as co-purchasing, co-use, and co- maintenance of certain DTs and/or the exchange of knowledge can help to take up technologies by reducing investment costs and maintaining the focus on organic and/or agroecological practices. • Financial support is fundamental, therefore the challenge for", "metadata": {"producer": "Acrobat Distiller 8.1.0 (Windows)", "creator": "Elsevier", "creationdate": "2025-04-26T11:11:18+00:00", "crossmarkdomains[1]": "elsevier.com", "crossmarkmajorversiondate": "2010-04-23", "creationdate--text": "26th April 2025", "elsevierwebpdfspecifications": "7.0.1", "robots": "noindex", "moddate": "2025-04-26T11:36:20+00:00", "author": "Cynthia Giagnocavo", "doi": "10.1016/j.techsoc.2024.102763", "keywords": "Digital technologies,Digitalisation,Multi-stakeholder,Organic agriculture,Agroecology", "title": "A multi-stakeholder perspective on the use of digital technologies in European organic and agroecological farming systems", "subject": "Technology in Society, 81 (2025) 102763. doi:10.1016/j.techsoc.2024.102763", "crossmarkdomains[2]": "sciencedirect.com", "crossmarkdomainexclusive": "true", "source": "data\\A-multi-stakeholder-perspective-on-the-use-of-digital-techno_2025_Technology.pdf", "total_pages": 15, "page": 11, "page_label": "12", "start_index": 0}}

In other words, digi- talisation will become a great ally of organic and agroecology farming when it offers solutions adapted to the characteristics, contexts and needs of this complex production system. 7. Limitations and future research This study aims to present an overview of the main aspects associated with the use of DTs by using a sizable general sample of relevant Eu- ropean countries. It is not a complete analysis at the European level nor a cross-country comparative analysis. Accordingly, the results may not be generalisable to all contexts. In order to provide a more holistic view and more specific information on the incidence of contextual issues, future research could consider a broader analysis by including more European countries and larger sets per country. Furthermore, the analysis of the aspects evaluated in non-European countries would allow the compar- ison of findings and the identification of key aspects relevant at the global level. Similarly, in order to obtain more generalisable results on this topic, future studies could use random sampling methods to reduce the risk of sampling bias. Methodological limitations due to the use of static data in this study could be overcome with research that uses longitudinal data and in- cludes quantitative variables to better analyse the interrelationship be- tween variables and improve understanding of associations. Future research could also include other types of stakeholders in the analysis, such as technology providers, other supply chain actors, and re- searchers, who could provide their knowledge and experience and contribute to building a clearer and more complete picture of the digi- talisation of organic and agroecological systems.

Decisions taken at the onset of the development phase are significant because the technology has not reached the market yet. The technology loses its malleability during the development phase because of entrenchment. Thus, the objective of a constructive technological assessment is to embed social aspects – additional perspectives – in the context of technological developments. In line with extant literature, a pivotal perspective is the (future) end-user of the technology. Hence, market acceptance remains a constraining factor in technological development, notably for renewable energy technology. However, existing studies have not included (future) end-users in development phases. They have always taken place after the technology has reached the market. To bring technological development and market acceptance closer, this study develops an innovative method that combines a conjoint experiment with a supervised machine learning model to predict the behavioural intention of end-users to accept a new (energy) technology. This study illustrates the proposed methodology through a conjoint experiment on seasonal thermal energy storage. The ML model uses input from a survey with a conjoint experiment to predict end-users’ market acceptance. With N = 12,096 (1008 participants exposed to 6 x 2 conjoint tasks), the ML model predicts behavioural intention with an accuracy of RMSE = 1.55 on a 10-point scale. The model is then used to predict hypothetical acceptance from mock end-users’ profiles and varying technological features. Thus, this study opens new perspectives for constructive technology assessment and conjoint experiment literature, and furthers discussions on social acceptance of energy technologies. 1. Introduction The urgent need to mitigate the threat of anthropogenic climate change is, in most cases, no longer debated. Ensuring affordable and renewable energy production and consumption is a pressing global challenge. Despite the pressure for each country to develop signifi- cantly more renewable energy infrastructures, meeting the ambitious global environmental goals comes with uncertainty and a risk of fail- ure (Upham, Oltra, & Boso, 2015). Scholars have acknowledged that innovation and cutting-edge (energy) technologies have a significant potential to mitigate climate change and bolster sustainable develop- ment (Al-Emran, 2023; Dogan, Ghosh, Hoang, & Chu, 2021; Svarc & Dabic, 2022) Although it is irrefutable that scientific and technological innovations in developing renewable energy production are a must, ✩ This paper belongs to an overarching project on ’’How to achieve sociotechnological breakthrough of seasonal thermal energy storage?’’ (SOTES) This project is financially supported by the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) with contract number CRSII5_202239. ∗ Correspondence to: University of Bern, Institute of Political Science, Fabrikstrasse 8, CH-3012, Bern, Switzerland.

In other words, social acceptance remains a barrier that regularly impedes the installation and operation of renewable energy infrastructures both at the community and individual levels (for a review, see Batel 2019, Milani, Dessi, and Bonaiuto 2024, Segreto et al. 2023).

{"page_content": "G. Zumofen the technology acceptance model (TAM) (Venkatesh & Davis, 1996). Recent additional models extended this research to the case of energy technology with, for example, an integrated sustainable energy technol- ogy adoption model (i-SETA) (Bonaiuto et al., 2024). The objective of these models has been to explain the acceptance of (renewable) energy technology. These models provide an encompassing perspective on the constraining factors – for example, perception, affect, social norms, or knowledge – that increase or decrease the behavioural intention to accept an RET. In brief, these constraining factors have been impeding countries from reaching their energy targets, with renewable energy remaining marginal in their energy mix (Dermont, Ingold, Kammer- mann, & Stadelmann-Steffen, 2017). Recent research has confirmed that three types of factors constrain the social acceptance of an (energy) technology: technological features and contextual and personal factors (for a review, see Milani et al. 2024). However, literature on social acceptance in the broad population have always taken place after the RET has reached the market. In other words, the undesirable failure of RET acceptance is acted upon when the technology is already a marketable product.1 At this stage, the RET is mature and room for technical modifications is tiny or even non- existent (Versteeg, Baumann, Weil, & Moniz, 2017). On the contrary, decisions taken at the onset of the development phase are decisive because the technology has not reached the market yet and, thus, is still malleable. Though social acceptance scholars reach conclusions and make recommendations, it is too late because the development phase is over. This implies that irreversibilities have taken place due to the enactors’ decision, i.e., entrenchment (van Merkerk & van Lente, 2005). In line with (Kadenic et al., 2024), the main objective of this article is to apply a proactive, rather than an ex-post, examination of the social acceptance of an (energy) technology. Social acceptance should be explored before the technology diffusion in the market in order to increase the adoption of the technology. Constructive technology assessment (CTA) literature states that social aspects, notably (fu- ture) end-users’ perspectives, should be embedded in the technological development process to prevent the future failure of technology accep- tance. Such a mismatch between studies on social acceptance taking place after the RET reaches the market and the loss of technological malleability once the technology is mature confirms that the techno- logical development of the RET and research on social acceptance have remained two separate areas. Bearing this in mind, this study aims to bring technological de- velopment and technology/social acceptance closer. It builds upon existing research on social acceptance of the RET that has recently been prominently applying conjoint experiments in its methodologi- cal approach (e.g. Stadelmann-Steffen & Dermont, 2021 or Vuichard, Broughel, Wüstenhagen, Tabi, & Knauf, 2022). Indeed, a conjoint ex- periment is a promising methodological approach for revealing par- ticipants’ multidimensional decision preferences, although they have only little (or no) information and knowledge related to the RET at stake (Kubli, 2021; Vuichard et al., 2022). Nevertheless, this study goes a step further by using data from a conjoint experiment with a supervised machine learning (ML) model with ordinary least square (OLS) regression. Combining a rating-based conjoint experiment with a supervised ML model, this paper develops an innovative method to predict the market acceptance of (future) end-users of (renewable) 1 This article acknowledges recent studies on the acceptance of exper- imental energy technologies, such as geoengineering, negative emissions, or the management of solar radiations (Sovacool, Baum, & Low, 2022a, 2022b).

This contributes to a CTA by predicting market acceptance for end-users and anticipating the risk of failure. A conjoint experiment for an RET answers the following fundamen- tal question: Is a technological factor of any significance for acceptance given other technological factors? In the existing literature, average marginal effects (AMCEs) and marginal means (MMs) have remained the most popular outcomes of conjoint experiments among social sci- entists. Both computational approaches display the mean outcomes averaged over the distribution of other factors and over the responses of other participants. However, they fail to account for individual-level predispositions and attitudes – that is, external variables – that either directly influence the decision preferences or interact with technologi- cal factors. Although a conjoint analysis can present subgroup analyses, it cannot capture the direct or interacting influence of individual-level factors on technological acceptance. That being said, technology accep- tance is a multidimensional decision preference that not only rests upon the features of the technology itself but also on the individual-level attitudes and predispositions. In agreement with Chapelle and Harchaoui (2004), Toubia, Ev- geniou, and Hauser (2007) and Ham, Imai, and Janson (2024), this study assumes that the application of a supervised ML model shows considerable potential for improving the predictive ability of conjoint experiments. A conjoint experiment is a learning problem that can be cast as a classification task in which participants accept or reject the technology 𝑦 from the basket with 𝑘 questions, or as a regression task with participants rating different technologies 𝑦 from the basket. Thus, this study combines the strengths of a conjoint model with the predictive power of ML. The proposed methodology is illustrated with a conjoint experiment on seasonal thermal energy storage (STES). This energy technology presents as an ideal case to measure social acceptance before an RET reaches the market. Not only are most STES technologies not suf- ficiently mature yet and remain malleable (Yang, Kramer, & Sun, 2021) but STES is also a potentially pivotal technology in the energy transition because seasonality is an inherent feature of the energy sys- tem (McKenna, Fehrenbach, & Merkel, 2019; Shah, Aye, & Rismanchi, 2018). This study begins with the TAF given by Huijts et al. (2012) and combines a conjoint experiment with a supervised ML model. First, the rating-based conjoint experiment benefits from an online cross- section survey in Switzerland (N = 1008). The survey and the conjoint experiment have been designed with a team of energy engineers with expertise in STES. This iterative and interdisciplinary approach ensured the technical validity of the experiment while also simplifying the content to make it understandable for laypeople. Considering that each participant revealed their preferences on 6 × 2 tasks, this article develops a supervised ML model on n = 12’096 observations. Second, it fits a supervised ML model with OLS regression with not only the technological features from the conjoint experiment, but also the individual-level predispositions and attitudes, i.e., input variables. The ML model learns from these inputs to obtain a function that accurately predicts the output which is the behavioural intention to install the STES technology, when presented with new input data. In the case of STES, the ML model can predict the behavioural intention to install the energy technology with a RMSE of 1.55 for the test dataset (on a 10-point scale). Although the accuracy of this specific ML model for STES accep- tance remains questionable, the strength of this contribution is to confirm that the innovative method to combine a conjoint experiment with ML is working and can be applied to other (energy) technology in the development phase. This method is the first to measure market acceptance of (future) end-users in the early phase of technological development.

Zumofen sufficient information, shape a positive or negative affect; form a per- ception of the risks, costs, and benefits; and evaluate their preferences regarding the technology. The early inclusion of (future) technology users is beneficial because the energy technology is still malleable in this phase. Energy engineers can test the combination of technological features with individual-level attitudes and predispositions to assess which one garners the highest market acceptance. Combining a con- joint experiment with a supervised ML model, (energy) technology developers can include the society in CTA to predict end-users’ be- havioural intention to accept or reject a technology. This iterative and interdisciplinary method is a step forward to bringing social science and technology developers closer together to overcome social acceptance barriers. 2. Theory and literature review This section discusses theoretical concepts and models that are pivotal to the acceptance of RET. First, it elaborates on the TAM and the TAF. Second, it discusses the literature on the social acceptance of RET. This leads to a focus on a CTA, which serves as a roadmap to include behavioural intention to accept an RET earlier in the technological development phase. 2.1. Behavioural intention and technology acceptance To begin with, it is seminal to separate the overlapping constructs of acceptability, acceptance, and adoption to determine an univocal definition of acceptance for this article. In their article, Bertsch, Hall, Weinhardt, and Fichtner (2016) explain that acceptability and accep- tance are often used synonymously. However, they clarify that the term acceptability refers to the rational and reasonable judgments of experts on the technology. Bonaiuto et al. (2024) define acceptability as a favourable or unfavourable attitude towards a given (energy) technology on a negative-positive scale. On the other hand, acceptance discounts rational and reasonable judgments. It is defined as a measure- ment of a positive or negative behavioural intention of accepting an (energy) technology by the stakeholders. In other words, it measures the subjective readiness to accept a technology (Bertsch et al., 2016; Bonaiuto et al., 2024; Upham et al., 2015). It considers implementation in a neighbourhood, or market buying. A last step is then the adoption that refers to the actual diffusion of the (energy) technology (Bonaiuto et al., 2024). In this article, the definition of (energy) technology acceptance aligns with that of Bertsch et al. (2016) and Bonaiuto et al. (2024), who consider acceptance as a subjective behavioural attitude towards a given technology. This definition is a self-reported measurement of the readiness to install or support a given energy storage technology. The vast majority of TAMs have highlighted the role of perception on behavioural intention to accept new technologies. In its seminal work, Davis (1985) suggested a TAM to explain the failure of tech- nology adoption. This model is built upon the theory of reasoned action (TRA) (Ajzen & Fishbein, 1980) and the theory of planned behaviour (TPB) (Ajzen, 1991). It considers that the actual acceptance of a technology is driven by a user’s motivation to accept – that is, use – this technology. This motivation is driven by two psychological constructs related to perception: perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use (Davis, Bagozzi, & Warshaw, 1989). First, perceived usefulness matches how useful or beneficial a technology could be for a user or the society as a whole. Second, perceived ease of use indicates how easy it is to use or implement the technology itself. In the original models, these two perceptions were hypothesised to be influenced by the features of the technology and assumed to have a direct impact on the attitude towards using the technology. However, in their final proposal, Venkatesh and Davis (1996) concluded that (1) perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use have a direct impact on be- havioural intentions rather than on the attitude towards using the technology; and (2) perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use were not only influenced by the features of the technology but also by other considerations and factors, such as users’ participation or nature of the implementation process. Consequently, they fine-tuned their model and opted for a more encompassing term to define the direct impact on user’s perception: external variables. For years, this TAM model has remained the leading model in predicting technology acceptance. Extending this literature to renewable energy technology, Huijts et al. (2012) presented the TAF. In this model, they emphasised the behaviour towards the technology. Huijts et al.

(2012) consider that the intention to accept is driven by three factors: behavioural intention, social norms, and perceived ease of use. First, Huijts et al. (2012) also distinguish between acceptability which refers to the favourable atti- tude towards a technology, and acceptance which measures the deliber- ate positive behavioural intention or readiness to accept a technology. Behavioural intention is defined as the user’s expectations regarding the use of the technology—that is, how good or bad the outcome will be for the user and society as a whole. This outcome is a weighing of positive and negative affects and perception of the technology—that is, perceived costs, perceived benefits, and perceived risks. This aligns with the construct of ‘acceptability’ (e.g. see Bonaiuto et al. 2024) Sec- ond, social norms refer to the influence of the social environment – that is, peers – on the user’s behavioural intention. This additional factor has been derived from the TPB. The TPB assumes that the intention to use a technology is also driven by subjective norms—that is, perceptions of how the social environment will endorse the system. Third, perceived ease of use is in line with the TAM. Going a step further, the TAF hypothesises that the behavioural intention is motivated not only by the technology itself – that is, the technological features of TAM – but also by contextual factors (Huitjs, Molien, & van Wee, 2014). Therefore, the TAF included three psychological constructs: trust, procedural fairness, and distributive fairness; these psychological constructs have either a direct or indirect impact, through affect and perception, on behavioural intention.2 Finally, Huijts et al. (2012) added that knowledge and experience of the technology are also mediating variables in this model. To summarise, and considering both the TAM and TAF, the ac- ceptance of a technology is not only driven by multiple constraining factors – perception and affect – associated with the technology but also by contextual factors, external variables, and social norms. These factors can directly or indirectly encourage or hamper the acceptance of the technology. 2.2. Social acceptance of renewable energy technologies With the urgent need to fight climate change, a vast literature on the social acceptance of renewable energy technologies (RETs) has developed – in parallel to literature on technology acceptance – in social science. This literature underscores that technology enac- tors should not only concentrate on the development of adaptation or mitigating energy technologies but also examine their social ac- ceptance with the aim of either reducing opposition or facilitating adoption (Milani et al., 2024) In a pioneering article, Sovacool (2014) concluded that disciplines related to social sciences are overlooked and unvalued in the energy research agenda. The article highlighted the potential for the field of energy research to ‘expand methodologically and topically’ (Sovacool, 2014, p.25) to reach other disciplines and vice versa. This recent literature trend appears complementary to research related to technology acceptance because it not only considers the multidimensional factors that influence acceptance but also indicates 2 It is worth noting that procedural and distributive fairness aligns with the literature on community acceptance of an RET that emphasises the role of procedural and distributional justice (e.g. see Vuichard et al. (2022)).

{"page_content": "G. Zumofen the different types of acceptance. As a reminder, this article defines (energy) technology acceptance as the negative or positive behavioural intention to accept a technology—that is, the subjective readiness to accept a given technology (Bertsch et al., 2016; Bonaiuto et al., 2024). It must be noted that this article follows Wüstenhagen et al. (2007), who isolated three dimensions of the social acceptance of RET: so- ciopolitical, community, and market acceptance. First, sociopolitical acceptance encompasses the more general level of acceptance of RET. Over the years, and with climate change reaching the top of political agenda-setting, the population progressively set its mind in favour of RET. Existing literature has confirmed that the sociopolitical accep- tance of RET, in general, is more or less a given (for a review see Batel 2019, Segreto et al. 2023). However, this does not automatically trans- late into a behavioural intention to accept an RET at the community or market levels (Aitken, 2010; Batel, Devine-Wright, & Tangeland, 2013; Bell, Gray, Haggett, & Swaffield, 2013). Second, community acceptance stands for the concrete acceptance by residents and authorities of the site of an RET infrastructure in their neighbourhood. It can be said that this dimension of acceptance is an extension of the relevant but criti- cised Not In My Backyard (NIMBY) literature (Wolsink, 2006). The term NIMBY characterises public opposition to the implementation of an un- desirable infrastructure at the local level, notably energy infrastructure, but support at the general level (Devine-Wright, 2009). To explain local opposition to infrastructure, a deterministic view of human psychology has been applied in empirical literature, considering that opposition is driven by physical proximity (for a review see Devine-Wright 2005). However, Wolsink (2006) questioned the reasoning behind this theory. He indicated that the NIMBY umbrella represents a constellation of attitudes that goes beyond the single explanation of physical proxim- ity. Recent literature demonstrated that community acceptance is also strongly driven by political processes. For example, Vuichard et al. (2022) demonstrated how the distribution of costs and benefits among residents and institutions – that is, distributional justice – and how the inclusion of residents in the decision-making process – that is, procedural justice – is of significance for community acceptance. Third, market acceptance highlights the actual market adoption of RET. It measures the extent to which individuals are willing to install RET. In brief, this study agrees with existing literature that has demonstrated that market and community acceptance remain pivotal challenges in the implementation stage (Stadelmann-Steffen & Eder, 2020; Sütterlin & Siegrist, 2017). Literature has also pinpointed that social acceptance is a multi- dimensional choice. This also aligns with the previously mentioned technology acceptance models, i.e., TAM and TAF. Stadelmann-Steffen and Dermont (2021) stated that individuals approve certain aspects of an RET technology while rejecting others. Thus, a weighing of pros and cons of different factors ranging from technical, political, and social perspectives comes into play for individuals, who also have their own attitudes and predispositions when deciding upon supporting or installing an RET infrastructure (e.g. see Boudet 2019, Dwyer and Bidwell 2019, Strantzali and Aravossis 2016, Vuichard et al. 2022, Vuichard, Stauch, and Dällenbach 2019, Walker and Baxter 2017). In a recent comprehensive meta-analysis, Milani et al. (2024) con- cluded that acceptability, acceptance, and adoption are driven or hin- dered by beliefs related to the technological features, the context (e.g. policy regulations or market considerations), and personal factors. This meta-analysis highlighted research on the role of contextual and general psychological factors in social acceptance. For example, Ellis, Barry, and Robinson (2007) emphasised three different factors that influence the social acceptance of RET. First, the technology itself carries a certain level of acceptance or rejection. For example, solar PVs, wind turbines, hydropower, battery storage, or hydrogen do not begin the road to acceptance at the same stage. Some might be hindered by a negative perception, while others may profit from a positive over- all perception. This depends on their technological features and their technological maturity. Second, technical, economic, and performance factors also alter the social acceptance of RET. For example, size, impact on the landscape, energy efficiency, CO2 emissions, investment costs, savings, and other", "metadata": {"producer": "Acrobat Distiller 8.1.0 (Windows)", "creator": "Elsevier", "creationdate": "2025-04-26T09:28:56+00:00", "crossmarkdomains[1]": "elsevier.com", "crossmarkmajorversiondate": "2010-04-23", "creationdate--text": "26th April 2025", "elsevierwebpdfspecifications": "7.0.1", "robots": "noindex", "moddate": "2025-04-26T10:18:10+00:00", "author": "Guillaume Zumofen", "doi": "10.1016/j.techsoc.2025.102833", "title": "Combining a conjoint experiment and machine learning model to include end-users in a constructive technology assessment: The case of seasonal thermal energy storage", "keywords": "Conjoint experiment,Machine learning,Social acceptance,Energy technology,Seasonal thermal energy storage", "subject": "Technology in Society, 81 (2025) 102833. doi:10.1016/j.techsoc.2025.102833", "crossmarkdomains[2]": "sciencedirect.com", "crossmarkdomainexclusive": "true", "source": "data\\Combining-a-conjoint-experiment-and-machine-learning-model-to-i_2025_Technol.pdf", "total_pages": 16, "page": 3, "page_label": "4", "start_index": 0}}

For example, size, impact on the landscape, energy efficiency, CO2 emissions, investment costs, savings, and other factors remain pivotal. Third, and as already men- tioned, individual predispositions and attitudes as well as contextual factors (e.g. distributional and procedural justice) remain decisive for social acceptance. Extant literature also underscored the mediating role of individual- level variables and the inherent trade-offs in social acceptance. Perlaviciute and Steg (2014) highlighted the overarching effect of individual values in mediating the evaluation of energy technologies. In line with Devine-Wright et al. (2017), sociocultural and public factors mediate the evaluations of energy technologies, with information also playing an important role (Author, in press). Stadelmann-Steffen and Dermont (2018) proved that acceptance involves trade-offs between technical and sociopolitical factors (e.g. maximising production capac- ity versus reducing the impact on the landscape) that are (partially) driven by individual attitudes and predispositions. Therefore, it is key to learn about these trade-offs and anticipate how individuals will negotiate them to develop an RET with a technological configuration that maximises the likelihood of being widely accepted, and ultimately becoming a product for the market. In their article, Jayaraj, Klarin, and Ananthram (2024) also highlighted this multilevel perspective to ensure residential solar energy storage uptake. The IPCC’s report (Masson-Delmotte et al., 2018) differentiates mitigation and adaptation technologies. Mitigation technologies, such as energy storage solutions, aim to reduce fossil fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions to mitigate the effects of climate change. A growing body of research has concentrated on the social acceptance of energy storage solutions. In detail, this literature has scrutinised the perception of energy storage in the media (Fabiani, Fronzetti Colladon, Segneri, & Pisello, 2023); the legal, social, and cultural barriers in the residential sector (Simo-Solsona, Palumbo, Bosch, & Fernandez, 2021); and the intention to adopt battery storage at the household level (Agnew & Dargusch, 2017). Although the literature indicated a low awareness of energy storage technologies, it confirmed the po- tential of these technologies in terms of acceptability, with many stakeholders considering that energy storage will contribute to energy independence, efficiency, and climate change mitigation (Ambrosio- Albalà, Upham, & Bale, 2019; Jones, Gaede, Ganowski, & Rowlands, 2018). Recent literature also incorporated energy storage in the ac- ceptance of an RET, measuring relative or cross-technology accep- tance (Ladenburg, Kim, Zuch, & Soytas, 2024). However, this article considers that a missing piece in this literature remains STES. 2.3. Bridging the gap between technological development and social accep- tance Although the TAM and the TAF share strong similarities with the literature on social acceptance, it must be said that, in most cases, the technological development of an RET and research on social acceptance have remained two separate spheres. This is where a CTA comes into play. The objective of a CTA is to embed social aspects in the context of technological developments to resolve the dichotomy between the benefits of a technology and its risks—that is, the technology dilemma (e.g. see Collingridge 1980, Schot and Rip 1996). For new technologies living in uncertain futures, the rationale underlying CTA has been to include more actors and, thus, more perspectives in technological development. One pivotal actor has been the society, specifically the (future) end-users of the new technology.

{"page_content": "G. Zumofen Fig. 1. Technology acceptance framework (TAF) in the early phase of technological development. Note: Proposed TAF with the deleted factors in grey. These factors cannot be measured in the early phase of technological development. By definition, technological development is driven by the actors involved and diffused in the society via different channels over time (Rogers, 1995). In the early development phase, their mapping of the technology takes place in the context of uncertainty and with a risk of failure. Garces, Daim, and Dabic (2023) confirmed that R&D decisions are not only complex because they involve many factors, but also take place in a context of high uncertainties. Information emerges gradually and different perspectives must be considered. Nevertheless, the decisions taken at the project’s onset are decisive because the tech- nology is still malleable (Versteeg et al., 2017). Technology loses this malleability during the development phase because of the expansion. This process of entanglement is inherent in technological development. It represents the consequences of irreversibilities arising from decisions taken by the enactors involved. In other words, these decisions shape the technology in a certain direction from where, in certain cases, there is no turning back (van Merkerk & van Lente, 2005). Further, Rip and te Kulve (2008) defined two categories of actors that play a role in technological development. First, enactors are the ones who develop the technology itself. They are developers, engineers, manufacturers, or investors. Second, selectors are the ones who eventually use the technology; this includes individual users, institutions, scientific actors, and legislators (Schot & Rip, 1996). In line with CTA, this study assumes that selectors must be involved as soon as possible in the development phase to provide input that can be integrated while the technology is still malleable. Thus, the principal aim of CTA is to bridge the gap between tech- nological development and sociopolitical acceptance of the technology. Including the society in an early phase, it broadens technological design, includes more reflexivity, and offers a comprehensive view of technological development (Doorn, Schuurbiers, van de Poel, & Gorman, 2013). Nevertheless, the main challenge for CTA is to involve technological selectors – that is, the end-users – rather than experts or organisations. Hence, the end-users might face an informational deficit that impedes them from evaluating their decision preferences regarding the technology. In their article, Assefa and Frostell (2007) conducted a questionnaire to encompass social acceptance in technol- ogy assessment. They concluded that respondents can hardly discuss future energy technology because of their low level of information and knowledge. The authors explain that respondents might voice an overall acceptance but have difficulty assessing acceptance of a specific future technology. Further to this, the so-called knowledge deficit model suggests that lacking knowledge regarding a policy, an issue, or a technology goes hand in hand with lower acceptance (Rhodes, Axsen, & Jaccard, 2014; Stoutenborough & Vedlitz, 2014). In summary, this section highlighted a gap in the existing literature. Although it pinpointed numerous models and papers related to tech- nology and social acceptance and explained how CTA calls for earlier involvement of society in technology development, it underscored the challenge to bridge the gap between technological development and social acceptance. No studies so far have focused on CTA and RETs.3 However, the following challenge remains: How to assess behavioural intention to install a technology for (future) end-users with limited information regarding a technology that is in the development phase? 3. Conceptual framework This study assumed that a more reflexive approach is suitable to shape the technology sufficiently early to avoid irreversibilities—that is, entrenchment. It built upon the TAF (Huijts et al., 2012) because this comprehensive model has been specifically designed for RET. It then fine-tuned this model to match a case of early involvement in the technological phase development of a new, unknown RET. Fig. 1 presents this TAF in the early phase of technological development. To adapt the TAF to not only an early phase of development but also to findings on the social acceptance of RET, this article excluded four dimensions and included one. First, it replaced the intention to accept with the intention to install – that is, market acceptance – an RET. Although this article departs from the definition of social accep- tance given by Wüstenhagen et al. (2007) it exclusively studies only one dimension—market acceptance.

{"page_content": "G. Zumofen presented combines individual-level characteristics and technological features to evaluate market acceptance. It assumes that these factors most drive the intention to install an RET in one’s own house.4 Second, this article considered that social norms can barely be as- sessed. Following the TPB, social norms capture the perception of how the social environment will endorse the technology (Ajzen, 1991; Ajzen & Fishbein, 1980). Considering that this technology has not yet reached the market, it is assumed that end-users can evaluate their preferences for the technology but cannot explore the evaluation of their social environment. Third, the article refrained from including experience as a mediating variable. Although individuals can hold some knowledge of a technol- ogy that has not yet been marketed, they do not have any experience with this technology. Nevertheless, individuals can have experience or affinity with related energy technologies. Three individual-level char- acteristics were included in the TAF model to approximate such energy technology affinity – that is, energy system with solar energy and energy system with heat pump – that measures if individuals have such energy technology in their homes and prosumerism that measures if individuals have already invested in a RET. Although these measurements do not measure experience with STES, they approximate the affinity with an RET to provide an encompassing TAF model. Fourth, this study selected market acceptance of STES at a single- family house level as a case to illustrate the proposed method. With a focus on market acceptance, the dimensions procedural and distribu- tive justice are no longer part of the acceptance framework. Indeed, costs and benefits are the sole responsibility of the end-users and, subsequently, only the end-user is involved in the decision-making process. Further, this article extended the TAF with individual-level atti- tudes and predispositions towards RET. Hence, external variables – for example, income, sex, or attitudes towards the environment – play a pivotal role for individuals assessing an energy technology, particularly when they are initially barely informed about it (Milani et al., 2024; Stadelmann-Steffen & Dermont, 2018; Venkatesh & Davis, 1996). These variables mediate the affect and perceptions, which then shape their behavioural intention to install the RET. 4. Materials and methods The objective of this study is to illustrate how a conjoint exper- iment with a supervised ML model with OLS regression can predict the behavioural intention of (future) end-users in the early phase of technological development. To do so, it benefits from a novel online cross-section survey, with a conjoint experiment on the acceptance of STES in Switzerland at the single-family house level. Hence, a survey is ideal to assess the acceptance of a (future) technology. Not only does it involve lay individuals who are directly concerned with market acceptance – that is, (future) end-users – but also ensures a sufficient number of observations to fit a supervised ML model. 4.1. Survey design The novel online cross-section survey was conducted in Switzerland between June 2023 and August 2023. It was a trilingual survey (Ger- man, French, and Italian). Participants were recruited via the polling agency LINK Marketing Services AG (YouGov Switzerland). To be precise, participants were recruited from the Federal Statistical Office 4 Additional factors could be integrated to obtain a finer-grained evaluation of market acceptance. For example, policy-related factors such as landscape regulation or subsidies could be added to the conjoint experiment. Although such inclusion is possible in a conjoint experiment, including additional factors in the experiment is a trade-off between external and internal validity with the risk of overloading participants. (FSO) sample frame for household surveys and received a paper letter with an invitation hyperlink and a password to access the survey. This implies that participants had to opt in. The survey could be filled in on a computer or a smartphone but participants were strongly encouraged to use a computer (or a tablet) to ease comparison in the conjoint experiment. The survey consisted of three parts and lasted approximately 25 min. The first part evaluated STES knowledge and attitudes related to the environment–energy debate. The second part included the conjoint experiment. The third part incorporated political-related and socio- demographic questions. To ensure representativeness, a quota sampling method stratified on cantons (70% German speaking-cantons, 25% French-speaking cantons, and 5% Italian-speaking cantons) was used.

The survey consisted of three parts and lasted approximately 25 min. The first part evaluated STES knowledge and attitudes related to the environment–energy debate. The second part included the conjoint experiment. The third part incorporated political-related and socio- demographic questions. To ensure representativeness, a quota sampling method stratified on cantons (70% German speaking-cantons, 25% French-speaking cantons, and 5% Italian-speaking cantons) was used. Ultimately, this study included 𝑁 = 1008 participants for the conjoint experiment.5 Further, 47.51% of the participants identified as female, and the average age is 49.18 years. 4.2. Case selection For the purpose of this study, the technology that was selected had to fulfil two aspects. First, the market acceptance of the selected technology had to be uncertain. Second, the features of the technology had to still be malleable—that is, it had to be in an early phase of technological development. With this in mind, this article opted for market acceptance of STES as a case selection. Looking at Switzerland, the Federal Statistical Office (FSO, 2023) indicates that the share of renewable energy in the energy mix accounts for approximately 28% in 2021. This is more than that in the EU (19%) but less than in front-runner countries such as Sweden (60%) or Finland (44%). The so-called new RET – that is, solar PVs, wind, biomass, and small hydropower – account for only 7.8% of the total electricity production. The literature has also indicated that the ex- tended rights for public participation have been hindering the actual implementation of energy infrastructures at the local level, with the population combating siting decisions (e.g. Broughel & Wüstenhagen, 2021; Vuichard et al., 2022). Thus, the government and the parliament have been modifying or implementing ordinances or laws to boost RET development in Switzerland since 2022 (Zumofen, 2022). This confirms that Switzerland must find a way to bridge the gap between technological development and social acceptance to reduce the failure of RET implementation. Seasonality is a pivotal feature in decarbonising the energy system not only in Switzerland but also worldwide (McKenna et al., 2019; Shah et al., 2018). Rather than being a renewable source of energy in itself, STES is a complementary energy infrastructure that transfers renewable energy production – for example, solar energy – over sea- sons. Indeed, a large part of the end-use energy fulfils either heating or cooling purposes, which display a strong seasonal character: in winter, people consume much more heat, and in summer people strive for more cooling. Renewable energy production displays a similar seasonal character. Therefore, STES can either store (surplus) heat in summer to use in winter or transfer cold from winter to summer for cooling purposes (for more details see Xu, Wang, & Li, 2014; Yang et al., 2021). This study supposes that STES is currently a missing piece in the energy transition, notably in Switzerland. While Switzerland exports surpluses in the summer, it has to import roughly the same amount of electricity in the winter months (FSO, 2023). 5 The recruitment of participants consisted of three samples. First, a few participants belong to a panel sample because this survey is part of an overarching project. The panel participants already participated in the first survey wave in the autumn of 2022. Second, a few participants were extracted from an additional FSO household sample and were fresh participants—that is, did not participate in the first wave. Finally, a sample of stakeholders was also surveyed. Nevertheless, the stakeholder participants were not included in this study and, thus, do not belong to the dataset.

{"page_content": "G. Zumofen Further, most STES technologies are not mature yet and remain in the rather early phase of technological development (for a re- view, see Pourahmadiyan, Sadi, & Arabkoohsar, 2023. This study is timely to bring social science and energy engineers closer together to develop STES technologies with features that match (future) end- users expectations. In detail, this study focuses on five different STES technologies: water tank storage, ice storage, thermochemical storage, borehole storage, and latent heat storage. These STES technologies differ in terms of storage material—that is, energy density, technical parameters (e.g. size), economic parameters (e.g. savings), and perfor- mance parameters (e.g. CO2 emissions). The five STES technologies also belong to the three basic STES types: sensible heat storage, latent heat storage, and thermochemical heat storage (Xu et al., 2014; Yang et al., 2021). 4.3. Role of (additional) informative material Recent literature on social acceptance (e.g. see Kadenic et al. 2024, Sovacool et al. 2022a) and the historical literature on CTA (e.g. see Doorn et al. 2013, Schot and Rip 1996) postulate that ac- ceptance research and practice should apply a proactive rather than a reactive approach to examine social acceptance before the (energy) technology reaches the market to avoid barriers and failure. Neverthe- less, with a technology in the early phase of technological development, a major challenge is the level of information available regarding the technology. This article takes for granted that most individuals have relatively low (or no) knowledge regarding the RET at stake given the relatively low awareness in the Swiss population. A challenge that comes up is to provide (future) end-users with sufficient information to form a behavioural intention regarding a technology that is barely known. Following De Best-Waldhober et al. (2009) recommendation, the innovative method presented in this article provides a substantive level of neutral information regarding the (energy) technology to cir- cumvent the risk of non-attitudes. This information must be technically valid and unbiased in order not to influence perception. In this article, survey participants were provided with two in- formative texts to contextualise the conjoint experiment and enable participants to form a behavioural intention. On the first page, an introduction text with stylised pictures summarised what STES is. In this text, STES was described and framed as an energy technology that can facilitate energy transition. For further details, see Fig. 7 in the Appendix. On the second page, more detailed information was provided to contextualise the conjoint experiment. The text introduced five assumptions on which the attribute and levels of the conjoint experiment were defined: the size of the residential area (i.e. how many apartments), the size of the apartments (in meter square), energy bill without an STES technology, connection with solar PVs and the power of these solar PVs, heating and cooling self-sufficiency without an STES technology, and the maximum lifetime of STES technology. To ease understanding and memorisation, the five assumptions were presented in the text and with a stylised picture. For further details, see Fig. 8 in Appendix. It is worth noting that (1) by clicking on an information button survey, participants could refer back to the assumptions (text and stylised pictures) at any time during the conjoint experiment, and (2) the informative material has been developed in collaboration with a team of energy engineers with expertise in STES. This interdisciplinary process ensured technical validity while simplifying the content for lay participants (i.e. internal validity). 4.4. Operationalisation and measurements To implement the TAF in the early phase of technological develop- ment, this study uses an online cross-section survey with a rating-based conjoint experiment to operationalise each variable. Fig. 2 depicts the TAF with the input and output variables, which fit the supervised ML model. 4.4.1. Input variables—individual-level characteristics In line with literature in social science, this study assumes that individual-level variables directly or indirectly influence behavioural intention. It is expected that sociodemographic characteristics play a pivotal role. For example, Marzouk, Salheen, and Fischer (2024) have recently demonstrated that implementation preferences of solar energy systems in residential areas are mostly driven by age. It is then necessary to include these variables in the ML model to obtain an encompassing understanding of the logic underlying the market accep- tance of an STES technology.

These questions were presented in the first (before the conjoint) and the last (after the conjoint) portions of the survey. Sociodemographic characteristics This study included sociodemo- graphic characteristics as input factors in the ML model: sex is a binary variable that takes the value 0 (male) and 1 (female); age is a continuous variable ranging from 16 to 95; education is an ordinal variable ranging from 1 (no diploma) to 12 (university diploma); income is an ordinal variable ranging from 1 (less than CHF 4,000 per month) to 6 (more than CHF 15,000 per month);residential situation is a binary variable with two cate- gories (owner or tenant); energy system with solar energy is a binary variable that takes the value of 1 if the participant is living in a building using solar energy, and 0 otherwise; and energy system with heat pump is a binary variable that takes the value of 1 if the participant is living in a building using a heat pump, and 0 otherwise. Attitudes Attitudes regarding energy, climate, and the environment were also included as input factors in the ML model: energy importance is an ordinal ranging from 1 (not important at all) to 5 (very important), power failure concern is an ordinal vari- able ranging from 1 (not concerned at all) to 5 (very much concerned), energy price concern is an ordinal variable ranging from 1 (not concerned at all) to 5 (very much concerned), and energy independence concern is an ordinal variable ranging from 1 (not concerned at all) to 5 (very much concerned). A variable to capture the tradeoffs between renewable energy production and landscape conservation was also included. The exact wording was ‘The expansion of renewable energy production might conflict with landscape protection. Do you want a Switzerland in which landscape protection is more important than the expansion of renewable energy production or a Switzerland in which the expansion of renewable energy production is more important than landscape protection?’ This variable is a continuous vari- able ranging from 0 (landscape conservation is a priority) to 10 (renewable energy production is a priority), Knowledge This study measured STES-related knowledge with a self- reported question tapping into the level of knowledge regarding STES. This is a 6-point scale variable ranging from 0 (Never heard about STES) to 6 (Very high knowledge of STES). The exact wording was ‘How familiar are you with seasonal heat storage?’. This question was asked before the conjoint experi- ment. Trust To measure trust, this study used two different variables. First, it measured trust in the energy provider using a 10-point scale ranging from 0 (no trust at all) to 10 (absolute trust). Second, it measured trust in the energy consultant with a 10-point scale ranging from 0 (no trust at all) to 10 (absolute trust).

Input variables at the individual-level (i.e. independent of technological features) in light grey. Input variables from the conjoint experiment (i.e. technological features) in white. Problem perception To measure the problem perception regarding cli- mate change, this study employed six questions, which were then aggregated into one index (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.84) on a 5-point scale, which ranged from 1 (absolutely disagree that climate change is a problem) to 5 (absolutely agree that climate change is a problem). For example, the items asked participants to position themselves on statements like ‘It is already too late to solve climate change’. Outcome efficacy Before running the conjoint experiment, partici- pants were tasked to determine how important could be STES to solve environmental and energy security challenges and to contribute to the energy transition. With three different vari- ables the survey measured outcome efficacy on a five-point scale ranging from 1 (not important at all) to 5 (very important) to (1) solve environmental challenges, (2) solve energy security challenges, and (3) contribute to energy transition. Personal norms In line with the TPB (Ajzen, 1991), this study hy- pothesises that personal norms relate to the moral obligation to install or refrain from installing RETs. Thus, the survey measures personal norms with a question on prosumerism. Personal norms is an ordinal variable ranging from 1 (I will probably never invest in renewable energy production) to 5 (I have already invested in renewable energy production). 4.4.2. Input variables—technological features Scholars in social science have demonstrated that a conjoint ex- periment is optimal for assessing the social acceptance of RETs (e.g. Stadelmann-Steffen & Dermont, 2021; Vuichard et al., 2022). Hence, the strength of a conjoint experiment is to simultaneously estimate the causal effects of multiple attributes and levels (Hainmueller, Hopkins, & Yamamoto, 2014). With a more realistic format than a traditional fac- torial survey experiment, it reveals individuals’ preferences for variants of RET alternatives and isolates pivotal factors in social acceptance. Moreover, a conjoint experiment reinforces external validity by pre- senting participants with many alternatives. It is also less prone to the social desirability bias, as it provides participants with multiple justifications for their choices (Wallander, 2009). In addition, Vuichard et al. (2022) confirmed that a conjoint experiment is ideal for assessing the acceptance of new technology with limited market information. The successive paired choices with multiple attributes ensured that partic- ipants could assess their behavioural intention to install a technology they barely knew about. In this study, the purpose of the TAF is to focus on technological features that remain malleable, assuming that these could then be adapted in the reflexive process (represented in white in Fig. 2). It concentrates on how these malleable features influence the perception of the technology. Thus, the attributes and levels (i.e. technological features) have been defined in an iterative and interdisciplinary process with a team of energy engineers with strong expertise in STES. Indeed, it is wise to ensure the technical validity of the levels to provide realistic combinations. Although it is correct that a few of the technological features are interrelated and not independent, it is worth noting that only one restriction was included in the conjoint experiment – that is, the one for the attribute size. This methodological approach fol- lows state-of-the-art guidelines on how to run a randomised conjoint experiment – that is, the third assumption of randomisation of the profiles (Hainmueller et al., 2014). Instead, ranges of realistic values for each attribute given the different STES technologies were determined by a team of energy engineers with expertise in STES. Thus, it is expected that each combination falls within these realistic ranges.6 Table 1 displays the seven attributes and the levels of the conjoint experiment. These attributes were integrated into the TAF to assess market acceptance: Storage material STES technologies vary in terms of the storage ma- terial they use to store energy over seasons. Storage material not only relates to performance with the energy density that comes with the material but could also relate to perceived risk with certain materials being perceived as riskier than others (i.e. chemical solutions).

{"page_content": "G. Zumofen Perceived benefits To balance the perceived cost, the attribute savings was added. This fuels the participants’ perceived benefits of the STES technology. It is worth noting that the savings can be positive, non-existent, or negative on the energy bill. Perceived performance Last but not least, the features of the technol- ogy influence its performance. Stadelmann-Steffen and Dermont (2018) proved that acceptance involves trade-offs with indi- viduals maximising the performance of the technology while still weighing their personal preferences. With that in mind, the conjoint experiment included four technical features as at- tributes. First, self-sufficiency remains a key performance pa- rameter of STES. It measures the extent to which installing an STES technology will increase self-sufficiency in heating (and cooling). Second, size is a also typical feature that involves trade-offs. On the one hand, a larger STES could provide higher self-sufficiency, and could also be financially beneficial with economies of scale. On the other hand, larger STES have a greater impact on the landscape. Moreover, certain types STES technology can be completely buried while others cannot. Liter- ature demonstrated that aesthetic integration and (in)visibility matters for acceptance (see e.g., Zhou et al. 2024). The size of the STES was measured in cubic meters. In discussions with the energy engineers, restrictions were also defined to separate above- and below-ground technologies to avoid illogical com- binations. Third, environmental impact was used to capture how many years are needed, with this STES technology, to have a net positive impact on the environment. Fourth, double use is another pivotal feature of STES. In other words, STES can be used for either heating or heating and cooling. A larger number of features (i.e. heating and cooling) are obviously advantageous but also come with additional costs and a different net positive impact on the environment. 4.4.3. Output variable—behavioural intention to install For the purpose of this study, the rating-based conjoint experiment was employed to fit the supervised ML model.7 Each participant replied to six paired choices each of which they had to rate the hypothetical STES on a scale of 0 (Not at all convincing) to 10 (Very convincing). The exact wording of the rating-based question was ‘Regardless of which STES you prefer, how convincing do you find each of these alternatives on a scale of 0 to 10?’ The rating-based question becomes the output of the ML model. This output variable is a continuous variable that ranges from 0 to 10 (for an example of a paired choice, see Fig. 10 in the Appendix). To run the ML model, the database was reshaped to have 12 observations for each participant. Indeed, each participant rated 6 × 2 STES technologies, thus yielding a total of 𝑁 = 12,096 experimental ratings. 4.4.4. A supervised machine learning model Once the data were collected through the survey, and notably the rating-based conjoint experiment, it can be exploited to run a supervised ML model. In brief, a supervised ML model uses input variables (𝑋) to predict an output variable (𝑌 ). The input variables fit the machine learning algorithm to map a function from the input to the output variable 𝑌 = 𝑓(𝑋). The goal of a supervised ML model 7 We refrained from using the choice-based experiment because the individual-level variables could not be integrated into the ML model. In the case of a choice-based conjoint experiment, participants are tasked to select one of the two alternatives (or none). Nevertheless, their individual-level characteristics are the same for the technology they select and the one they do not select. This implies that the influence of individual-level variables cancels out with the experiment. On the contrary, a participant rates the alternatives independently from each other.

A supervised ML model requires coded data to train the model and find the best-fitted function. In this study, the output variable is market acceptance—that is, behavioural intention to install the STES technology. It is a continuous variable ranging from 0 (not convincing) to 10 (very convincing). Then, it uses a regression as a statistical approach to map a function that best fits the relationship between the input (i.e. the predictor) and the output (i.e. the target) variables. In a second step, this best-fitting function can be exploited to make predictions. For the purpose of this study, a supervised ML regression model with ordinary least square (OLS) regression was presented to predict market acceptance. This linear model minimises the sum of the squares of the residuals—that is, the distance between the predicted values and the target values. In the end, the ML model minimises the error between the predicted values and the actual values of the target variable. To determine the model’s accuracy, this article uses the root mean squared error (RMSE). It displays the root of the squared mean of the distance between the actual and the predicted values. RMSE is a popular metric to assess the accuracy of a supervised ML model by reporting the information in the same unit as the target variable.

Note: Rating-based question in the conjoint experiment. 5. Empirical results To begin with, Fig. 3 displays STES-related knowledge of survey participants. As expected, most participants had a low level (or no) knowledge regarding the technology at hand. This not only confirms that most STES technologies are in the early phase of technological development but also pinpoints the pivotal role of additional infor- mative material in the survey (see section 4.3). In detail, 61% of participants indicated that they had never heard about STES before this survey. On the other hand, only 15% asserted a rather high or high level of knowledge regarding STES. This low level of knowledge suits the purpose of this study and makes the conjoint experiment and the supervised ML model rather conservative, with a risk that causes many participants to be undecided regarding the profiles of STES technologies they are presented with. Fig. 4 presents a histogram that evaluates the distribution of the output variable (i.e. behavioural intention to install). It confirms that participants gave a value of 5 – on a 0–10 scale – for a fifth of the profiles they were presented with. This peak can be interpreted as a rather high level of indecision. In line with the information deficit theory, it is postulated that this indecision is related to the low level of STES-related knowledge among the participants (see Fig. 3). Then, a Kurtosis measurement of 2.37 confirms that the output variable is close to a normal distribution, and a Skweness measurement of −0.28 indicates that the distribution is slightly left-skewed. These measure- ments evaluated the tailedness of the distribution relative to a normal distribution and the asymmetry of the distribution. Before exploring how ML uses the input and output from a conjoint experiment to predict the market acceptance of a technology in the early phase of development, it is wise to have a look at the results of the conjoint experiments. Fig. 5 displays the marginal means of the seven attributes that were presented. The output variable is the rating-based question ranging from 0 (Not convincing at all) to 10 (Very convinc- ing) at the single-family house level. First, the results highlighted a significant influence of the attribute storage material. STES technologies using boreholes and pipes as well as edible salt and water increased the probability that the technology is installed. Second, investment cost had a negative linear influence on behavioural intention to install – that is, the more expensive the technology is, the less likely it is to be installed. Third, saving on the energy bill had a significant positive influence on behavioural intention to install – that is, the more a participant saves on his or her energy bill, the more likely he or she is to install the STES technology. Fourth, with regard to heating self-sufficiency, only an increase up to 100% has a significant positive influence on intention to install. Fifth, the influence of size is complicated to disentangle. It seems that smaller STES infrastructures are more likely to be installed. Sixth, the environmental impact has a significant negative influence on intention to install if it takes 50 years to reach a net zero impact and a significant positive influence on intention to install if it takes (only) 10 years or less to reach a net zero impact. Last but not least, an STES technology that not only provides heating but also cooling features is more likely to be installed. Verifying the robustness of the conjoint experiment, it is worth noting that most of the assumptions given by Hainmueller et al. (2014) were met. First, the levels were randomly allocated to participants. One noteworthy exception is the attribute size. For this attribute, a filter to differentiate between above- and below-ground technologies was designed. Second, the preferences of participants remained stable over the experiment (i.e. no carryover effect). Similarly, the ordering of the STES profiles within the paired choices did not influence the intention to install. To reach these two conclusions, separate conjoint models were run for the two first paired choices and the two last paired choices as well as for the rating tasks presented first and the rating tasks presented second. Fourth, together with the team of energy engineers, illogical combinations were excluded—that is, levels stuck to a realistic range based on the ground assumptions that were provided to participants as informative texts. Finally, it is necessary to note that the conjoint experiment did not respect the assumption of randomisation of the profiles.

This ML model uses both the individual-level variables and the technological features from the conjoint experiment as input variables to predict the output variable—that is, behavioural intention to install an STES technology at the single-family house level (for further details, see 2). To include categorical variables, they were transformed into multiple new binary variables using a one-hot encoding method. This transformation was needed for the attribute storage material in the conjoint experiment. In other words, the one-hot encoding method gen- erated six binary variables that indicate whether the storage material – for example, chemical solution – was included in the STES profile presented to the participants.9 To predict behavioural intention to install an STES technology, this article trained the ML model with input variables–that is, the predic- tors. The ML model used 80% of the dataset to train the ML model and 20% of the dataset to verify the accuracy of the predictions. Fig. 6 displays the ML model with OLS regression. It compares the real output 8 For further details regarding the assumptions, please contact the author. 9 To factor in mutual exclusivity, it is worth mentioning that only one out of the five new binary variables can get the value of 1. The other binary variables will obtain a value of 0 because the same attribute cannot have multiple levels for the same observation in the conjoint experiment.

Note: Marginal means (MMs) represent the mean outcome across all appearances of a particular conjoint feature level, averaging across all other features.

First, the ML model predicts outputs in a smaller range than real outputs. Although the real outputs vary from 0 to 10, (i.e. rating-based questions), the predicted outputs vary from only 2 to 9. It is assumed that the rather high indecision with a fifth of participants indicating 5 on the 0–10 scale (see Fig. 4) pulled the predictions towards the centre of the scale. Second, this article evaluated the accuracy with the RMSE. With the final ML model, a RMSE of 1.53 for the trained dataset and 1.55 for the test dataset were obtained. In other words, this implies that the predicted output is given within an error interval of 3.08. For example, if the model predicts an output of 7.5, the real output lies in a range of 5.95–9.05. In addition, the model computed a mean absolute error (MAE) of 1.93 (for the test dataset). Once trained, this supervised ML model can be used to make predic- tions regarding the behavioural intention to install a STES technology. It is then possible to predefine mock individual-level variables and vary the technological features to predict the market acceptance of a future STES technology. Table 2 presents three different mock individual pro- files with varying technological features for an STES technology. Then, using these profiles and technological features as new input variables, it is possible to predict the output variable – that is, behavioural intention to install – with an accuracy of RMSE = 1.53. With the mock examples in Table 2, the supervised ML model computed behavioural intentions to install of 4.40, 4.94, and 8.46 for the three profiles, respectively. 6. Discussion and conclusion The chronic climate change threat and the more recent need to secure energy independence boosted research on the social acceptance of RETs.

Although social acceptance scholars reach certain conclusions and make recommendations for the technology, it is too late because the development phase is over. This was the starting point of this study. This article developed a method that combines a conjoint experiment with a supervised ML model with OLS regression to predict the market acceptance of STES. This method contributes to the literature on CTA, which aims at embedding social aspects, notably end-users, in technological devel- opment. It is a step further to bring technological development and social acceptance closer together. This method aligns with Kadenic et al. (2024) and Versteeg et al. (2017). This literature called for proactive (i.e. ex-ante) research and examination of practices on the social acceptance of (energy) technologies in the development phase. In other words, social acceptance must be determined prior to technology diffusion. Embedding social aspects earlier in the development phase has the potential to avoid irreversibilities, which could constrain social acceptance when the technology reaches the market.

{"page_content": "G. Zumofen This article illustrated this methodology using STES as an applica- tion. The ML model achieved a TAF for technology in the early phase of development. In brief, the ML model exploited as input both the individual-level variables extracted from the survey questions and the variation in technological features from the conjoint experiment to pre- dict behavioural intention to install STES—that is, market acceptance for a technology. A major contribution of this article is to extend (Huijts et al., 2012) TAF to the case of technology in the early phase of devel- opment when social norms and awareness are minimal or lacking. This is in keeping with De Best-Waldhober et al. (2009), who recommended providing participants with substantial neutral information regarding an unfamiliar technology to prevent the risk of measuring non-attitudes or pseudo-opinions. To generate this information, this article opted for an interdisciplinary collaboration with a team of experts on the technology in question. This iterative process safeguards the technical validity and neutrality of the information while ensuring that the information is understandable for laypeople with no experience with the technology. In brief, with a trained model of 80% of the dataset, the ML model predicted the output with an accuracy of RMSE = 1.55. In other words, the difference between the predicted and the real output lay within a range of 3.1 on a 10-point scale. Though the accuracy of the method remains questionable in this specific case, the strength of the article is to demonstrate that this innovative method works. Thus, the ML algorithm mapped a best-fitted function from the input to the output variables and was then able to predict new output from mock profiles with predetermined individual-level variables and technological fea- tures. Interestingly enough, the results indicated that many participants had a difficult time forming a behavioural intention. In other words, a fifth of the outputs indicated a value of 5 on the 10-point scale. On one hand, this is no surprise as participants had a low level (or no) of knowledge regarding STES, which is a technology in its development phase and is not a marketable product yet. On the other hand, this indecisiveness pulled the predicted value towards the centre of the scale. This might be a recurrent problem in the case of new technology. Thus, it should be addressed in further studies. Finally, from a methodological perspective, this study contributes to two literature fields. First, it contributes to the CTA literature by de- signing a method that includes end-users in technological development. Considering practical implications, this method stands as a ready-to-use solution to embed social aspects early in the technological develop- ment phase (Doorn et al., 2013; Versteeg et al., 2017). Technological enactors can develop a survey with a conjoint experiment to predict technology acceptance in the early phase of technological development even when a technology is experimental. This speaks to recent research that explores expert opinion on the social acceptance of experimental technologies, such as negative emissions, geoengineering, or chemical solar energy storage (Kadenic et al., 2024; Sovacool et al., 2022a, 2022b). This innovative method can reduce the risk of market failure by guiding technological development—that is, avoiding irreversibilities that then become constraining factors in market acceptance. Second, it also contributes to the literature on conjoint experiments. Using conjoint data to run a supervised ML model is an innovative method that must be further explored. Therefore, this method extends recent research on social acceptance that regularly exploited the conjoint experiment method to study the multidimensional choice of the ac- ceptance of an RET (e.g. see Stadelmann-Steffen and Dermont 2021, Vuichard et al. 2022). This article also furthers (Sovacool, 2014) pioneering claim that social acceptance of technology is overlooked in the energy research agenda. It methodologically expands research on social acceptance to suggest a method to examine social acceptance in the technological development phase and reach out to the energy research agenda. To attain this goal, it relies on the recent social science literature that has concluded that acceptance is driven by three factors—that is, tech- nological features and contextual and personal factors (for a review, see Milani et al. 2024). It confirms the importance of taking the multi- level perspective into account (Jayaraj et al., 2024) to predict social acceptance with higher accuracy. The conjoint experiment confirmed that (future) end-users favour a STES using either water or the ground as storage material, with a lower investment cost (below CHF 20,000) and with potential saving (higher than CHF 400 per year), thereby allowing higher heating self-sufficiency (100%) with a small impact on the environment and with heating and", "metadata": {"producer": "Acrobat Distiller 8.1.0 (Windows)", "creator": "Elsevier", "creationdate": "2025-04-26T09:28:56+00:00", "crossmarkdomains[1]": "elsevier.com", "crossmarkmajorversiondate": "2010-04-23", "creationdate--text": "26th April 2025", "elsevierwebpdfspecifications": "7.0.1", "robots": "noindex", "moddate": "2025-04-26T10:18:10+00:00", "author": "Guillaume Zumofen", "doi": "10.1016/j.techsoc.2025.102833", "title": "Combining a conjoint experiment and machine learning model to include end-users in a constructive technology assessment: The case of seasonal thermal energy storage", "keywords": "Conjoint experiment,Machine learning,Social acceptance,Energy technology,Seasonal thermal energy storage", "subject": "Technology in Society, 81 (2025) 102833. doi:10.1016/j.techsoc.2025.102833", "crossmarkdomains[2]": "sciencedirect.com", "crossmarkdomainexclusive": "true", "source": "data\\Combining-a-conjoint-experiment-and-machine-learning-model-to-i_2025_Technol.pdf", "total_pages": 16, "page": 12, "page_label": "13", "start_index": 0}}

This corre- sponds to the influence of technological features. But then, combining this dataset with the individual-level characteristics and running an ML model, this article confirms that personal factors also play a role in reaching an accuracy of RMSE = 1.55 to predict the market acceptance of any predetermined STES with varying technological features and personal factors. Overall, this study is a step further in bringing technological de- velopment and social science closer. Employing an innovative method, it included (future) end-users earlier in the development phase. This method enables technology enactors to make development decisions that match (future) market acceptance of the (energy) technology. The next steps are to apply this method (1) to other emerging technologies and (2) to different ML methods and operationalisation. This article is a first application of an innovative method to exploit data obtained from a conjoint experiment. It is necessary to test this method on additional (energy) technologies that are not in the market yet to determine the extent to which the method could or should be implemented in the development phase of any technologies that might face reluctance in terms of acceptance once they are in the market. Further, applications could determine the extent to which including a method combining a conjoint experiment with an ML model in a CTA is relevant for technology enactors in practice and in the social acceptance literature in general. Practically, this method could anticipate and prevent market failure of future (energy) technologies. In addition, future studies should fine-tune the ML model and the operationalisation of the output variable. Hence, this article applies a simple linear regression to survey data using a 0–10 rating-based ques- tion as an output. First, the model could test different output variables to measure market acceptance. The 0–10 rating-based questions could be re-operationalised to obtain a binary output or an ordinal output with different levels of acceptance. The rating-based question could also be combined with the classical choice-based questions displayed in a conjoint experiment. This re-operationalisation could help refine the output variable. Second, alternative ML models could be applied depending on the output variable used. For example, it could be in- sightful to run a logistic regression, a random forest algorithm, or a neural network to obtain a more accurate prediction model. However, this goes beyond the scope of this initial article, as this is only a first step to using a conjoint dataset with an ML model and not by computing traditional AMCEs or MMs. This implies that it is the first time that both individual-level characteristics and conjoint attributes and levels are examined together and not separately with subgroup analyses. Thus, the aim of this article was first to determine the relevance and applicability of the method before digging into the fine-tuned methods. This calls for further research on the subject.

While there are a large number of technology acceptance models, none of them includes belief- related variables. Developed within the EC H2020 ABC-Salt project, this contribution focuses on the cross- validation, in a large sample (N = 1016), across eight European countries, of the Biofuels Beliefs Scale (BBS). The BBS is composed of 26 items, organized into six factors (i.e., Policy Making Legitimation, Emissions Sus- tainability, Global Environmental Sustainability, Technology Compatibility, Local Socio-Economic Sustainabil- ity, and Cost Savings). Factors are distinct, reliable, and each one composed of a psychometrically acceptable number of items. The validation procedure fulfilled the adequacy requirements regarding convergent, discrim- inant, and predictive validity. The BBS could be useful both for testing models on technology acceptance in future studies and for communication campaigns on biofuel-related issues in applied contexts (e.g., pre-/post-assess- ment, monitoring, etc.). 1. Introduction Biofuels occupy a significant role in the context of the energy tran- sition. While other renewable sources and electrification are considered as capital for fulfilling energy demand for domestic use and industrial production, biofuels are currently considered one of the most viable, sustainable, and renewable energy technologies for the transport and logistic sector [ 1 ]. The shift from fossil fuels to biofuels in everyday life for transportation, power generation, and heating would offer several economic, environmental, and social benefits. However, biofuels still include features that might inhibit their social acceptance [ 2 – 4 ]. There is evidence that the development of the first generation of biofuels (i.e., the ones produced from grown-on-purpose biomass) can lead to nega- tive effects in terms of both greenhouse gas emissions and competition with food production, especially in developing countries [ 5 ]. Recent biofuel production techniques have tried to reduce the likelihood of these potentially negative effects, for instance proposing as feedstock the microalgae, which have a number of advantages such as fast growth rate and lack of competition with food production [ 6 ]. However, a vibrant public debate has occurred about biofuel ’ s local and global impacts and thus, if biofuels are to be developed at an industrial scale within the EU, public opinion needs to be seriously taken into consideration. In sum, the study of biofuel social acceptance seems quite important for an effective energy transition. The aim of this paper is to contribute to the understanding of biofuel social acceptance by developing a new tool to measure people ’ s beliefs about biofuels. 1.1. The relevance of beliefs for technology acceptance Beliefs have been considered as important antecedents of behavior in different theoretical models since decades (e.g., see [ 7, 8 ]), including the well-known Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB, [ 9,10 ]). If values have been postulated as the general and abstract principles that guide an * Corresponding author. E-mail address: s.ariccio@uu.nl (S.

Beliefs should not be confused with objective knowledge, which is sometimes included in psychological social acceptance models [ 13 ]. In fact, while measures of objective knowledge usually focus on assessing how correctly informed people are about biofuels (e.g., with true-false tests), measures of beliefs simply concern how much people trust spe- cific representations, without rating them as correct or wrong. Baral [ 14 ] found that people ’ s socio-demographic characteristics are a key factor for their objective knowledge about biofuels. However, research shows that objective knowledge of a topic, as measured by specific psychometric tools (e.g., true-false questions) can be quite irrelevant to decision-making (e.g., [ 15 ]). At the same time, beliefs are strongly associated with intention and behavior [ 16 ]. Research into hydrogen technologies reveals that beliefs concerning contextual and technology-related aspects, such as perceived effects, exert a more profound influence on acceptance than objective knowledge, as demonstrated in the studies conducted by Achterberg et al. [ 17 ] and Huijts and Van Wee [ 18 ]. Beliefs should also not be confused with subjective knowledge, i.e. how much individuals think that they know about biofuels. More generally, subjective knowledge can be considered as a sort of contextual self-confidence [ 19 ] and has not much to do with specific conceptions people have about this technology. As a general trend, individuals tend to possess limited subjective knowledge about sustainable energy technologies, like biofuels, as noted by Pagiaslis and Krontalis [ 20 ]. Subjective knowledge can significantly shape people ’ s beliefs. As shown in the study conducted by Siegrist and Cvetkovich [ 21 ], greater knowledge of a dangerous technology is directly associated with a greater tendency not to trust the people responsible for managing that technology, thus accentuating the perceived risk associated with it. Beliefs, instead, are important because they measure people ’ s rep- resentations about a given technology, without judging them [ 22 ]. In fact, beliefs are crucial drivers orienting the individuals ’ responses in terms of attitudes (e.g., acceptability), intentions to adopt (acceptance) or not, and possible behavioral adoption concerning the target of renewable and sustainable energy technology (e.g., biofuels, in the present case). Regarding their concreteness and specificity, beliefs can be challenged via communication, information provision, and experi- ence interventions [ 23 ]. For instance, in a recent study about the acceptance of wind energy, Cranmer et al. [ 24 ] show that experiencing wind energy infrastructures through virtual reality is an efficient way to weaken prior detrimental beliefs concerning expected visual and acoustic impacts of wind turbines, thus increasing their acceptance. Since scientific knowledge is socially interpreted in its creation, diffusion, and use, it is crucial to explore the beliefs of different stake- holders, together with their values, aims, and their power relationships [ 25 ]. The goal of the present paper is to validate a scale that can be used to reliably assess beliefs about biofuel technology and about the context where it can be employed. Such a scale could then be included in existing technology acceptance models to better understand which specific beliefs affect people ’ s acceptability attitudes and acceptance intentions towards biofuels over and above objective and subjective knowledge. 1.2. Technology-related and context-related beliefs As Fig. 1 shows, a recent qualitative study by Dessi and colleagues (2022) found that the main incentives and barriers to biofuel acceptance can be summarized in three macro-areas: a first macro-area includes beliefs regarding the intrinsic technological aspects of the target tech- nology to be adopted (Technology macro-area); the second macro-area consists of beliefs on the adoption process ’ contextual factors, i.e., those variables dealing with economics and marketing as well as related policies and administrative measures (Context macro-area); finally, the third macro-area refers to personal factors (cognitive, affective, and social) of its adopter (Person macro-area). Some social-psychological and interdisciplinary models, like the Sustainable Technology Acceptance Model (SETA, [ 27 ]), have tried to explain the acceptance of energy technologies by focusing on the Person macro-area and providing standard tools to measure the related vari- ables (e.g., [ 28 ]). The SETA model is among the most comprehensive frameworks for examining the acceptability and acceptance of renew- able and sustainable energy technologies. It integrates established Fig. 1. Macro-areas, factors clusters, and variables related to biofuel acceptance (based on [ 26 ]). S.

Despite its importance, the SETA primarily focuses on the social-psychological characteristics of adopters, whereas other dimensions - such as perceived technological, contextual, and personal features - which could increase the prediction of the acceptability and acceptance of renewable and sustainable energy technologies, are not considered. To address this gap, Bonaiuto and colleagues [ 31 ] recently introduced the integrated sustainable energy technology adoption model (i-SETA), including variables about two categories of beliefs related to biofuels, i.e. contextual and technological - as determinants of biofuels ’ acceptability and acceptance - which were not considered in existing models. The present study, deals specifically with beliefs that people have about these under-represented characteristics of biofuels, and aims at developing a tool to measure such beliefs. This tool is developed with the aim of having, for future studies, a validated biofuel belief measure, allowing comparison at different times or between groups. It is impor- tant to stress that, rather than on the actual features of a given tech- nology (e.g., biofuels) or of a given context (e.g., a region or a country market and economy, or policy), the target here is to understand the beliefs that people hold on these topics. Technology acceptance models have so far focused on the role of variables such as values, attitudes, and norms (e.g., [ 27,32,33 ]). The positive feature of this kind of models is that, since they include broad psychological variables, most of the items representing the measured variables focus on socio-psychological dimensions (e.g., values, social norms, emotions) and are not tailored to a specific technology in terms of item content. Thus, these models can be tested with different tech- nologies and in different contexts, allowing comparisons. On the other hand, such models seem to be less adequate in providing specific in- dications about beliefs people have about a specific technology and its context, as that would be possible only via very items focusing on the specific technology or on the specific context. The intrinsic characteristics of the technology itself (e.g., chemical properties, environmental impact, feedstocks, emissions) and the contextual aspects (e.g., economic/market aspects and political/ administrative aspects), as interpreted by potential adopters in relation to their beliefs and perspectives, shape the acceptability, acceptance, and adoption of a particular renewable and sustainable energy technology, as highlighted in the qualitative study on biofuels social acceptance by Dessi et al. [ 26 ]. Beliefs concerning the intrinsic charac- teristics of biofuels exert both positive and negative influences on the technology ’ s acceptance. In terms of negative factors, Jayed et al. [ 34 ] identified specific chemical attributes, like the use of vegetable oils in traditional fossil fuel engines, the necessity for new infrastructure development [ 35 ], and concerns related to land use changes [ 2 ]. Conversely, positive attributes encompass the compatibility of biofuels with conventional engines and existing petrol stations [ 36 ], as well as the potential for reducing harmful emissions [ 37 ]. Beliefs about contextual aspects also play a crucial role in the acceptance of sustain- able and renewable energy technology. In this sense, challenges hin- dering the acceptance of biofuels include beliefs about the high production costs associated with microalgae [ 38 ] and the limited accessibility of biofuels at nearby filling stations [ 39 ]. Conversely, contextual factors that promote the acceptance of biofuels include be- liefs about their potential to strengthen the local economy [ 40 ] and the presence of government support programs [ 41 ]. Thus, providing a better and more systematic approach to the measurement of contextual and technological beliefs, to be integrated with the existing models, would provide more concrete hints on how to adjust information and communication in a specific situation, such as in the case of biofuels. Even though some scholars (see Table 1 ) have proposed instruments to measure technology-related beliefs, the existing tools are sparse and usually not validated with a systematic psychometric approach (including reliability checks and scale structure exploration). As re- ported in Table 1, response scales of existing measures are mixed in nature (e.g., Likert or dichotomous scales) and diverse in format (i.e., 5 or 7 points for Likert scales), thus hindering the comparability of existing results.

There is therefore a literature gap in terms of a reliable and valid tool to measure biofuels beliefs according to a multidimensional structure – i. e., attempting to cover all the relevant features (technology features as well as contextual features in terms of both economics and market and politics and administration) – and employing a standard set of items using the same response scale. Filling such a gap would represent an advancement within the specific field of biofuels social acceptance, and more broadly within the field of renewable and sustainable energy technologies social acceptance, in terms of increased standardization of measurement for the relevant beliefs considered as drivers, or barriers, of biofuels and other new energy technologies acceptability, acceptance, and adoption. Such an effort would offer an immediate reliable and valid tool for the measurement of biofuels beliefs, and more generally would offer a process benchmark for the development of future similar tools to measure any other sustainable and renewable energy technology beliefs. In general, such a scientific endeavor should increase cross-studies comparisons, and thus opportunities for cumulative scientific knowledge. 2. General and specific aims The current paper aims to propose and cross-validate the Biofuels Beliefs Scale (BBS) on an international sample of general public and stakeholders. This tool will allow scholars to better investigate the specific understanding that diverse stakeholders have of biofuels. The BBS measures beliefs about the biofuels ’ energy technology per s ´e, as well as about its relevant context including economics/marketing fea- tures and politics/administrative features. Consistently with the general aim, two specific research aims have been defined, namely. - Specific Aim 1: exploration and verification of the scale ’ s factorial structure, to get distinct and reliable factors, each one composed of a psychometrically acceptable number of items; - Specific Aim 2: testing of the scale ’ s validity, specifically through the psychometric verification of both convergent and discriminant val- idity [ 50,51 ]. 3. Method 3.1. Procedure Recruitment was carried out between July 2021 and January 2022 with participants from eight European countries (Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Sweden, Norway, and United Kingdom), both laypeople and biofuel stakeholders. The eight countries were chosen for being partners of the EU project that funded this study and, even if they cannot be considered as a representative EU sample, they are good examples of the variety of EU countries as for what con- cerns size and different degrees of local biofuels development [ 52 ]. The survey was uploaded online (on www.qualtrics.com ) and self- administered by participants. To recruit general public participants, the English version of the questionnaire was shared on the Prolific platform ( https://www.prolific.com ) on July and August 2021. The platform was set to collect one hundred participants per country, balanced by gender and age. To reach biofuel stakeholders, Qualtrics ’ Online Panel service was employed. This is a commercial service pro- vided by the company Qualtrics to collect data in populations that are not easily reachable on generic platforms (e.g., Prolific). The service actively contacts people belonging to the defined population and asks, in exchange for compensation, to fill in the questionnaire. The initial request to Qualtrics consisted of finding fifty biofuel stakeholders living in the eight Countries included in the EU project. However, the service informed that, considering the specificity of the topic, it was only possible to find biofuel stakeholders from the four largest Countries (Italy, UK, Germany, and France). To ease participation from the stakeholders of each selected country, the questionnaire, originally developed in English, was translated into Italian, French, and German. In this way, four links were created to which the different stakeholders were directed according to their native language. The questionnaires were spread during January 2022. To define participants as “ biofuel stakeholders ” quality check questions and enforced screening criteria were included at the beginning of the questionnaire (e.g., Work in bio- fuel/bioenergy sector: If “ Definitely not ” OR “ Maybe not ” was chosen then the participants were excluded). The entire project of investigation, detailed in its execution modalities and participants involved, has been submitted to the Ethics Committee of the Department of Psychology of Developmental and Socialization Processes, Faculty of Medicine and Psychology, Sapienza University of Rome (Italy), receiving the approval to proceed (submitted April 28, 2021, final approval May 27, 2021, Protocol n. 742, Pos.

One hundred participants were from Belgium, 153 from France, 153 from Germany, 152 from Italy, 101 from the Netherlands, 101 from Sweden, 103 from Norway, and 152 from the United Kingdom. Con- cerning gender, the sample consisted of 419 women (41.2 %) and 598 men (58.8 %). The sample had a high educational level and came from a variety of fields of study ranging from STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) disciplines to SSH (Social Sciences and Humanities). In addition, employed participants worked in different organizations (SMEs, Large Companies, Governmental Organizations, Academies and Research Centers, and NGOs) ( Table 2 ). Sampling covered both the general public (79.4 %) and expert stakeholders (20.6 %): regarding expert stakeholders, professional categories that are relevant to biofuels were included, based on a previous mapping study within the same project [ 53 ]. 3.3. Tools The focus of this paper is on the validation of the Biofuels Beliefs Scale, which was part of a larger questionnaire including other tools and had the aim of testing a theoretical model of biofuel acceptance (see [ 31 ]). The initial BBS consisted of sixty-eight items measuring biofuel features about the “ Technology ” and the “ Context ” macro-areas, the latter composed of Economy/Market and Policy/Administration aspects (see Appendix 1 for the list of items and their origin). Such items were developed to measure the features that emerged in the first two macro-areas reported in Fig. 1, based on the qualitative results from Dessi et al. [ 26 ], namely. - for the “ Technology ” macro-area, the features related to Chemical properties, Compatibility with conventional engines and existing facilities, Compatibility with (current) infrastructures, Perceived feedstock sustainability, Change of land use, Perceived emissions, and Environmental impact; - for the Economy and Market aspects within the “ Context ” macro- area, the features related to Price, Food cost, Economic benefits, Economic support, Limited availability on the market, Local devel- opment, and Energy independence; - for the Policy and Administration aspects of the “ Context ” macro- area, the features related to Regulatory policies on the one side, and Support programs and Information actions on the other side. All the items were measured via a 7-point Likert-type response scale, from 1 = “ strongly disagree ” to 7 = “ strongly agree ”. Different validity criteria were verified, namely: i) convergent 2 This value refers to the whole questionnaire. S.

For validity testing, the following measures were considered. • Values (hedonic, altruistic, biospheric, egoistic, and traditional). The first 16 selected items are issued from the “ Environmental Value Survey ” (E-SVS; [ 11,56 ]); while the last 5 items related to tradi- tionalism are derived from the Schwartz Value Survey (SVS; [ 57 ]), measured on the standard one 7-step Likert, with the extremes \"opposite to my values\" and \"of extreme importance\". Reliability ranges between α =.70 and α =.91. • Subjective knowledge about biofuels (adapted from [ 20 ]) included 6 items, e.g., ‘How knowledgeable are you regarding the production of biofuels? ’ Answers ranged on a 7-point Likert scale, from \"Not at all \" to \"Completely \" ( α =.94). • Biofuels Attitude Scale as Acceptability (BASA, [ 31 ]). A semantic differential consisting of 16 adjective pairs, e.g., “ I think that biofuel technology is: alien/familiar; harmful/safe ”, on a 7-step Likert response scale, composed of two factors: Positive Attitude Toward Biofuels ( α =.93) and Biofuels Usability ( α =.68). • Biofuels Intention Scale as Acceptance (BISA, see [ 31 ]): eleven items, organized into two factors. The factor Use Intention is composed of 5 items, e.g., “ How willing would you be to fuel your private vehicle with biofuels? ” ), with response options ranging from 1 = “ Very un- willing ” to 7 = “ Very willing ”, with the added, “ Not applicable ” option, α =.84. The factor Socio-Political Support Intention is composed of 6 items, related to the following question: “ If there was a discussion in your area about whether or not to place a biofuel station, how likely would you be to take the following actions in favor or against it ” (e.g., Sign a petition; Make a donation). Response scale ranges from 1 = “ I would certainly not do this ” to 7 = “ I would certainly do this ”, α =.90. • Items about respondents ’ socio-demographic characteristics. 3.4. Analyses For this data elaboration, R Studio version 2022.02.03 was employed, specifically the statistical packages “ foreign ” [ 58 ], “ pastecs ” [ 59 ], “ car ” [ 60 ], “ psych ” [ 61 ], “ lavaan ” [ 62 ], “ GPArotation ” [ 63 ], and “ esemComp ” [ 64 ]. 3.4.1. Specific Aim 1: exploration and verification of the scale ’ s factorial structure Since the BBS items were developed based on both the literature review and the outcomes of a qualitative study [ 26 ], an exploratory approach (including a parallel analysis and an exploratory factor anal- ysis, EFA) was applied in the first step after data screening and cleaning. A cross-validation procedure (see [ 65,66 ]) was pursued by randomly splitting the sample into two halves, to develop a model on the first half of the sample (i.e., the calibration sample, N = 512), and then to confirm it on the second half (i.e., the validation sample, N = 505). Moreover, an exploratory structural equation modeling (ESEM) factor analysis was run on the same part of the sample employed for the EFA. The first analysis, involving the first half of the sample, thus intended to find a preliminary structure of the scale. Since Bartlett ’ s test and Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) test confirmed the sampling adequacy and the correlation matrix factorability, the sixty-eight items were submitted to EFA, using the principal axis factoring (PAF). Consequently, Cron- bach ’ s alpha values were computed to assess factors ’ reliability. The following decision criteria were employed: scree-plot and parallel analysis [ 67, 68 ], minimum average partial (MAP; [ 69 ]), and Bayesian information criterion (BIC).

On the same half of the sample, an ESEM analysis was then con- ducted, employing the maximum likelihood robust estimator. Three solutions were tested: four, five, or six factors. Following Marsh et al. [ 70, 71 ] we used an orthogonal target rotation with an epsilon value of 0.5. Since there was no specific hypothesis on which indicators should load on the expected factors, the ESEM, i.e., a modern technique inte- grating the classical EFA, allowed us to further explore the data and confirm the solution that emerged from the previous exploratory analysis. Later, confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was run on the second half of the sample, testing four-factor, five-factor, and six-factor models. The robust maximum likelihood (RML) method was employed to account for non-normal data (since Mardia ’ s coefficients were significant; [ 72 ]). For inter-model comparisons, since all models were nested, Δ CFI > 0.010 was taken as evidence of robust differences in relative model fit Cheung and Rensvold [ 73 ]. 3.4.2.

The CFA approach allows the verification of convergent and discriminant validity [ 51,75 ]. Specifically, the size and statistical sig- nificance of factor loadings connecting different manifest variables (i.e., items) with a latent variable (i.e., the Policy-Making Legitimation) provide evidence for convergent validity, whereas correlations between latent variables that are lower than their factor loadings provide evi- dence for discriminant validity ([ 50 ], pp. 263 – 264). Zero-order correlations (Pearson ’ s r ) were computed between the scale ’ s factorial scores (as derived from EFA) and other socio- psychological constructs included in the questionnaire (see the Tools section). According to the hetero-trait-mono method coefficient, thresholds for this test are usually considered to be 0.30 (small, thus divergent), 0.40 (mildly convergent), and 0.50 (clearly convergent) [ 76 – 80 ]. 4. Results 4.1. Preliminary analyses Data were checked for univariate and multivariate normality (see Appendix 2 ). The Shapiro-Wilk ’ s test was significant (all p <.001) for all 68 items, meaning that data are not normally distributed and that the planned analysis for testing Aims 1 and 2 can be applied to the data set with consideration of normality assumptions violations. Since sporadic missing data was observed, each missing value was replaced by the mean value of the corresponding variable. 4.2. Specific Aim 1: Exploration and verification of the scale ’ s factorial structure and factors ’ reliability The EFA run for fulfilling Specific Aim 1 produced the following outcomes. A significant Bartlett ’ s test of sphericity ( χ 2 (2278) = 13312.3, p <.001), and a Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) of 0.88 indicated that the correlation matrix was suitable for factor analysis. The Parallel Analysis scree-plot revealed two visible elbows at the fourth and sixth eigenvalue (see Appendix 3 ). The Velicer MAP achieved a minimum of 0.01 with seven factors, while BIC achieved a minimum of \u0000 8093.83 with six factors. Finally, the parallel analysis indicated an asymptotically flat- tening trend after the sixth eigenvalue, a solution supported by the BIC. Due to the presence of two elbows in the parallel scree-plot, we tested a four-factor, a five-factor, and a six-factor solution. The conduction of a series of EFAs allowed the deletion of several items (n = 42), which were excluded for either item saturation on the factor inferior to 0.40 or similar saturation of the same item in different factors, which leads to an ambiguous interpretation. Since different decision rules supported either a seven- or a six-factor solution, but only six eigenvalues were greater than one, six factors were retained and orthogonally rotated for interpretation; moreover, the explained variance of the scale was higher in the six-factor solution. For these multiple reasons, this solution was retained. The final Biofuels Beliefs Scale was composed of twenty-six items ( Table 3 ). The Exploratory Structural Equation Modeling (ESEM) was used to confirm the results from the EFA, run on the calibration sample. Three solutions were tested, respectively including four, five, or six factors ( Table 4 ). The four-factor model did not show an acceptable fit to the data. The five- and six-factor models were instead able to achieve an acceptable and a good fit to the data, respectively. The six-factor model (see load- ings in Appendix 4 ) confirmed the structure that emerged from EFA and outperformed the five-factor model on all model selection criteria. The six-factor solution was thus retained for subsequent tests. Table 5 reports the results of the CFA that was performed to fulfilling Specific Aim 2. As for the ESEM, the four-factor model presented a not-acceptable fit to the data with CFA analysis. With the same analysis, instead, the five- Table 3 Factor pattern matrix after VARIMAX rotation.

The six-factor model outperformed the five-factor model on three out of three model selection criteria (i.e., AIC, BIC, and SABIC). Lastly, because of its consistently better performance across different indices of fit (i.e., CFI, TLI, RMSEA, and SRMR), the six-factor model was retained for subsequent tests. Concerning validity, the use of CFA yielded a six-factor solution that fulfills both convergent and discriminant validity criteria (see [50]). In particular, inspecting the magnitude and the statistical significance of factor loadings connecting different observed variables (i.e., items) with a latent variable (e.g., Cost Savings, Policy Making Legitimation, etc.) allows for testing convergent validity, whereas correlations between latent variables that are lower than their factor loadings provide evi- dence for discriminant validity [50]. Factor loadings are presented in Fig. 2, while correlations between variables are presented in Table 6. 4.3. Specific Aim 2: Validation of the scale’s factorial structure Lines 1–6 present correlations between the BBS factors; Lines 7–12 indicate correlations between the BBS and some variables employed in studies on biofuel acceptance, i.e., values and subjective knowledge on biofuel; Lines 13–16 show correlations between the BBS factors and measures of biofuel acceptability and acceptance. 4.3.1. Convergent and discriminant validity Correlations among factorial scores are reported: all the correlations between factors, in absolute value, vary between 0.00 and 0.48; these are lower than their factor loadings since among the latter the lower one equals to. 49 on the corresponding latent variable. This outcome is proof of convergent validity, thus providing evidence also for discriminant validity. Discriminant validity is accounted by the correlations of BBS factors with Values [11]; [57] and Subjective knowledge about biofuels. As expected, such correlations were found as non-significant or of small magnitude, ranging from 0.06 to 0.33. 4.3.2. Predictive validity The correlations between BBS factors and some potential dependent variables were computed for verifying the predictive validity. The Bio- fuels attitude components, i.e., Positive Attitude Toward Biofuels and Biofuels Usability, showed differences in their relationship with BBS factors. In fact, Biofuels Usability was not associated or only weakly associated (r ranging from 0.07 to 0.27) with BBS factors, and this suggests that the feasibility of biofuels’ usage is a different construct but still related to beliefs about biofuels. On the other hand, the Positive Attitude component is positively associated with BBS factors (r ranging from 0.12 to 0.60), demonstrating a degree of association with beliefs about biofuels from small to large. Finally, Use Intention and Socio- Political Support Intention (components of the Acceptance scale), were positively associated with beliefs about biofuels (r ranging from 0.11 to 0.51), showing a degree of association with beliefs about biofuels from small to large. 5. Discussion 5.1. A standard self-report scale to measure biofuel beliefs The goal of this study was to develop and validate a Biofuel Beliefs Scale to measure what people think about specific technology-related and context-related characteristics of biofuels. The outcomes of the cross-validation analyses allow to obtain a set of distinct and reliable factors, each of them including an acceptable number of items, in line with Specific Aim 1. The subsequent validation procedure fulfilled the adequacy requirements regarding convergent, discriminant, and pre- dictive validity [50,51], consistently with the Specific Aim 2. More in detail, a six-factor scale composed of twenty-six items that have a stable structure and satisfactory fit indices emerged. Such factors were respectively labeled Technology Compatibility, Emissions Sus- tainability, Global Environmental Sustainability (for the technological features); Local Socio-Economic Sustainability and Cost Savings (for the market-economics contextual features); and Policy Making Legitimation (for the administrative-policy contextual features). These dimensions cover both aspects of the beliefs that emerged in Dessi et al. ’s (2022) results and of beliefs identified in the literature review: i.e., on the one side Technology aspects, and on the other side Contextual aspects, which covers both biofuels’ economy and policy issues.

For instance, biofuels ’ global impacts and emissions had already been examined by Bakhtiyari et al. [ 42 ] in Iran and by Pagiaslis and Krontalis [ 20 ] in Greece, but in both these cases using single items. Also, beliefs about biofuels ’ prices and their impact at the local level have already been investigated [ 44 ], [ 46 ], [ 45 ]. Other studies had instead considered the role of policymaking and the importance of economic benefits associ- ated with the use of biofuels [ 43,48 ]. Technology Compatibility has rarely been considered in literature, but, for instance, Milazzo et al. [ 36 ] mention it as one of the prominent issues to deal with to ease the spread of biofuels. Local effects of biofuels were instead previously analyzed in a study about public acceptance of renewable energies in Germany [ 47 ]. With the present contribution, BBS is to our knowledge the first standard multidimensional self-report scale to offer a systematic comprehensive set of factors capable of simultaneously measuring all the relevant beliefs regarding both technological and contextual features of biofuels, overcoming the fragmentation highlighted above. BBS fac- tors could be considered in future research for different purposes, such as to test their role as drivers, or barriers, concerning acceptance, and criteria to test the efficacy of interventions aiming to improve those beliefs with targeted public and stakeholders. Beliefs about biofuels can also be of fundamental importance in shaping the type of policy sub- system (e.g., collaborative, or adversarial), and the relative balance of power between policy coalitions that are responsible for implementing the recent technology. As reported by Rietig [ 25 ], there is a close link between scientific knowledge, learning, and beliefs, especially in the field of environmental policymaking and in its relationships with eco- nomic development-focused policies. The European Renewable Energy Directive was dominated by political disagreements between two polarized coalitions. There was an initial agreement on increasing the share of renewable energies in transport that turned into conflict after new scientific evidence emerged on the potential negative environ- mental impacts of first-generation biofuels. As reported, beliefs can be dynamic and could uncover pre-existing conflicts between policy- makers. Therefore, the collaborative policy subsystem shifted to an adversarial policy subsystem [ 47 ]. Within such scenarios, a tool like the BBS could help to fulfill the twofold goal of measuring the beliefs compatibility of different involved actors and, at the same time, offering a standardized instrument to compare ideas and opinions of the different agents of change. Concerning Specific Aim 2, results showed that most correlations between factors are low, ranging between 0.06 and 0.48. Thus, discriminant validity is confirmed for all the factors. Moreover, the study shows that, on average, beliefs about biofuels are associated with rele- vant outcomes, such as Biofuels Acceptability (Attitudes) and Accep- tance (Intentions), thus consistently with the predictive validity hypothesis. However, any conclusion about BBS factors ’ predictive validity should be further tested through longitudinal studies. Similarly, measurement invariance (on the geographical and on the temporal scale) is yet to be tested, since the current sample was too small and unbalanced for this kind of analysis [ 81 ]. The high number of items eliminated during the analysis needs to be mentioned as a potential limitation of this study. More than half of the items were removed during the analyses because they had either poor saturation on all the factors or multiple saturations on different factors. However, this important selection of items is not surprising considering the exploratory nature of this study. In this sense, it is plausible that the factor analysis technique helped to select the clearest and least ambig- uous items included in the original pool. 5.2. Applications and future research Research on biofuels is growing and, while there are already several technology acceptance models, none of them seems to include psycho- metrically reliable and valid measures of context-related and technology-related beliefs, typically relying on ad hoc measures.

{"page_content": "Technology in Society 81 (2025) 102780 9 outlining the importance of social science applications in sustainable biofuels aviation research, Anderson et al. [ 82 ] pointed out that existing studies on biofuels demonstrate the centrality of the context in under- standing how to best approach the implementation of renewable energy projects at both local and global level. Most of the existing research is based on not easily quantifiable and reproducible metrics (vs. the ones provided here by a standardized survey): the preference for these types of indicators leads to an incomplete assessment, in the best scenario, and to invalid conclusions and inaccurate predictions, in the worst scenario. This preference so far also contributed to inadequate research at the local level, where biofuel development has the most important impact [ 82 ]. Since research on biofuels is growing and there is a lack of social-psychological tools to measure what people think about them (i. e., biofuel beliefs), BBS has many implications both for research and applications. In the context of research, including BBS in the current technology acceptance models would allow better integration of specific beliefs into the technology acceptance models (Hujits et al., 2012), since such a dimension has so far been neglected in comparison to other variables (typically, other features of the person unrelated with the specific targeted energy technology). This would be also consistent with the approach of other behavioral models, such as TPB [ 10 ] and VBN [ 12 ]. From an applied perspective, this study provides a tool that fulfills the need of social science methods scrutinizing public acceptance of biofuels [ 82 ]. Energy governance includes a number of stakeholders - such as NGOs, intergovernmental organizations, private companies, public-private partnerships, transnational advocacy networks, and financial institutions. Being able to compare the beliefs of the different stakeholders can be useful to inform local policies and strategies, including public initiatives of citizen engagement and involvement, in order to plan the local sustainability transition and drive the progress toward the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs by UN [ 83 ]). Further studies should test the stability of this factorial structure in a European representative sample, as well as in non-European cultural and linguistic contexts. Moreover, ideally, non-paid participants should be involved in the studies, to limit the effect of extrinsic motivation and compensation-related sample bias on study results. The quantitative nature of this tool allows to run comparisons across contexts, even though an integration with qualitative methods could help to account for the context dependency of results. It is also possible that some of the items will not work in all context and that some of the items we have excluded would work with specific publics. Further work conducting ANOVAS and cluster analyses to for stakeholder segmentation and trying to understand different in- terpretations of the items or identifying items that work/do not work in specific publics is certainly welcome. In this sense, it is to remark how, since biofuel is such a novel technology, it is likely that beliefs around this topic will change not only quantitatively, but also qualitatively. New beliefs may emerge through different times and places that are not accounted for in the tool here proposed. It is thus likely that to account for the plastic structure of beliefs, this tool will have to be adapted and updated in the future following belief changes proposed by different epistemic communities. For instance, the factor focusing on the compatibility of biofuel with current infrastructures might need to be updated when new in- frastructures will be available. As a research application, it will be interesting to include these measures of beliefs in existing models to predict the acceptability of biofuels and similar technologies (e.g., as in the SETA model; Hujits et al., 2012). Discrete choice experiments would be a particularly valuable tool to consider adoption intentions contrasted by different alternatives (e.g., EVs, traditional fossil fuels), and not looking at bio- fuels alone. Another interesting avenue consists of using the BBS to check for the efficacy of interventions aiming to contrast misbeliefs and misinformation about biofuels and the context in which they can be applied. In these respects, overall, the BBS tool represents one of the Table 6 Zero-order correlations between BBS factors, Values, Subjective knowledge, BASA factors, and BISA factors.

Conclusion Since current technology acceptance models seem to have neglected the role of specific beliefs, the goal of this study was to develop a tool to measure biofuels beliefs, and, more specifically, beliefs related to the technological features of biofuels with their social and environmental impacts; and to the context where the biofuels would be implemented, considering the relevant economics and politics. To reach such a goal, a 26-item scale was developed that included six factors: Policy Making Legitimation, Emissions Sustainability, Global Environmental Sustain- ability, Technology Compatibility, Local Socio-Economic Sustainability, and Cost Savings. In a recent literature review about biofuels’ public opinion in the EU countries, Løkke et al. [5] called for research approaches integrating information deriving from both qualitative and quantitative data to capture the complexity of public perception about emerging technolo- gies (see also [82] for a similar suggestion). Consistently, the develop- ment of the Biofuels Beliefs Scale was pursued through a mixed method approach: item development was framed both on the results deriving from a qualitative study based on interviews [26], and on the adaptation of previously published surveys, reflecting a quantitative perspective. Further studies should consider implementing this scale within existing technology acceptance models and theories (e.g., [27,31]), to acknowledge the role of beliefs in the social-psychological processes driving behavioral choices towards new renewable and sustainable en- ergy technologies. From a practical point of view, the use of BBS would help monitor assessments in a range of promoting initiatives for better communication about biofuels, to diffuse its use among stakeholders. This would be particularly relevant for specific corporate stakeholders, especially in the field of transport [82] and logistics, for which choosing sustainable fuels is often an action of Corporate Social and Environ- mental Responsibility. A use of BBS at the institutional level would also allow for a better understanding of lay people’s attitudes toward bio- fuels and, ultimately, to inform local policies, thus contributing to make our society as more sustainable by relying on cleaner and renewable fuels. As outlined by [84], to make biofuels more acceptable and accepted, appropriate leveraging is needed. Often, the resistance and skepticism toward biofuels technologies are linked to inherent unconvincing technology characteristics, and mistrust toward the adoption context, as well as to some adopters’ features. Thus, BBS can also be combined with qualitative methods, such as in-depth interviews, focus groups, or ethnographic investigations focused on understanding these beliefs, their underlying contexts, and their dynamic change, which might also bring to update the tool. Additionally, BBS could play a pivotal role in designing studies employing formative methods: for example, within participatory workshops or deliberative polling which could be employed to foster greater engagement and enhance knowl- edge capacity among stakeholders. Achieving the goal of biofuels’ adoption requires a comprehensive approach to promote its acceptability and acceptance by also consid- ering multiple biofuels features whose beliefs can be known and moni- tored by appropriate standard tools such as the BBS. Similar tools could also be developed with reference to other new renewable and sustain- able energy technologies for the same purposes: the development of the BBS could serve as a benchmark in this respect too.

First, universities are increasingly focused on enabling entrepreneurship to fulfil their \"third mission\" of contributing to the regional economy. Second, they are intensifying efforts to communicate the entrepreneurial university portfolio as evidence of their societal value. Although previous research has explored these areas, how universities convey their entrepreneurial efforts re - mains unclear. Are entrepreneurial universities primarily portrayed as institutions that train future entrepre - neurs, spin out companies and intellectual property, or drive cultural change towards entrepreneurship? To address this, we use natural language processing techniques to provide novel insights into how universities communicate entrepreneurship-focused activities and capability-building efforts. Our empirical focus is South Korea ’ s top ten universities, for which we analyzed 7889 national newspaper articles in terms of a sociological capital framework. Our findings indicate that human capital-related activities receive greater emphasis than cultural and social capital capability-building efforts. This finding suggests that the third mission may not be clearly conveyed in coverage of the entrepreneurial university. The managerial implications are that university leadership can enhance communications to better showcase their societal connections and contributions in line with their third mission. 1. Introduction Universities are increasingly expected to contribute to socio- economic development in the communities, regions, and countries where they are based. Changing political and social contexts require universities to justify their access to public funding by demonstrating their positive socio-economic impact ( Breznitz et al., 2022; Compag - nucci & Spigarelli, 2020; Guerrero and Dabi ´c, 2023, chap. 1; Guerrero et al., 2024 ). They should not simply exist as an “ ivory tower ” that operates outside of its local context ( Etzkowitz et al., 2000 ). To address public pressures and to meet growing rankings expectations for positive impact ( Dabi ´c, 2021 ), university leadership are motivated to positively convey what they are doing to deliver value through education, research and service to wider society. They strive to communicate their value-add to prospective graduates in the form of future employment prospects, in terms of contribution to scientific advances, and to regional development, talent and growth ( Grant, 2021; Seri & Compagnucci, 2024; Shapiro, 2005 ). University leaders deliver on, and communicate, these aims by investing in knowledge exchange and stakeholder engagement efforts, such as creating public communications teams that leverage a growing array of media channels ( Benneworth et al., 2015; Borlaug & Elken, 2024; Peruta & Shields, 2018 ). Despite the growing importance of entrepreneurial universities communicating their societal value, research has only examined aspects of this phenomenon. Marketing and media communications researchers have examined the contours of universities ’ rising public engagement efforts ( Peruta & Shields, 2018 ), and management studies, entrepre - neurship, and higher education scholars have analyzed the leadership organization, activities, and performance of the entrepreneurial uni - versity ( Borlaug & Elken, 2024; ForlianoDe et al., 2021; Meek & Gia - niodis, 2023 ).

{"page_content": "yet been examined. This leads us to our central research question: How is the entrepre - neurial university portrayed in the media? Specifically, is it presented as an institution with entrepreneur-flavored education and research, or a driver of entrepreneurial mindsets and activity beyond the university? Our empirical context is the national media coverage of South Korea ’ s ten highest-ranked entrepreneurial universities over a 23-year period (1998 – 2021). Our focus on Korea offers a geographic extension of research on the entrepreneurial university, especially in the East Asian context. The entrepreneurial university phenomenon has thus far been widely studied in North American and European contexts, with less research examining non-Western contexts. Only a modest number of studies focus on East Asia ( Eun et al., 2005; Park & Jeong, 2015; Wong et al., 2007 ). Korea is an interesting case to study because Seoul ’ s startup cluster is now ranked in the global top 20 by Startup Genome, and the country ’ s entrepreneurial universities likely contributed to this rise ( D-W Sohn et al., 2007; Mok, 2013 ). We use text-as-data techniques to analyze 7889 media documents to assess how South Korea ’ s entrepre - neurial universities have been covered in high-circulation national newspapers. We find that Korea ’ s entrepreneurial universities emphasize human capital terms most, accounting for 51% of the terminology used to describe university activities. Cultural capital language, in contrast, is least used, representing just 15%. Human capital efforts are most-often described in terms of ‘research ’, ‘program ’, and ‘educate ’ over the 20 + year period, just as cultural capital descriptors are most-often ‘culture ’, ‘prize ’, and ‘promote ’. Collectively, Korea ’ s top universities speak most about skill-based activities, and relatively less about efforts to foster an entrepreneurial mindset, to build bridges, and to enable capabilities through coaching and mentoring. In short, the entrepreneurial univer - sities are conveying their core education and research activities, but say less about their efforts to drive connections and encourage entrepre - neurial culture. This focus on human capital activities is perhaps not surprising, given the primacy of education and research to the institu - tion, but it does raise questions about how much the entrepreneurial university is being conveyed as part of a wider, or distinct, third mission. These findings have clear implications for campus leadership. First, by revealing evidence of how the entrepreneurial university is por - trayed, universities can reflect on whether this is what they intend to convey. Rather than entrepreneurial university communications centering on education and research, would university leader like to elevate its emphasis of the networking opportunities and entrepre - neurial mindset building that these activities strive to boost? To what extent is the portrayal of the entrepreneurial university meant to align with the more traditional framing of the university ’ s thrust, versus showing a broader, and more varied, means of engaging in socio- economic development? Third, insight into strategic communications can inform a review and reconsideration of the entrepreneurial uni - versity offerings themselves. This aligns with scholarly calls for uni - versity leaders to proactively manage the entrepreneurial university ( Leih, 2016 ), and to reimagine the “ rebirth ” of the model ( Meek & Gianiodis, 2023 ) that best delivers value for the university and wider society. Perhaps additional offerings, that go beyond entrepreneurial education and research, which constitute a greater range of interactions with the local community, are needed to deliver on a distinct third mission (and not the university ’ s ‘business as usual ’ education and research with an entrepreneurship theme). The paper is structured as follows: The next section reviews literature on the university ’ s third mission and its public engagement. Section 3 develops our ‘types of capital ’ theoretical framework for understanding the language used to portray the entrepreneurial university. Section 4 then details the data and methods employed, starting with the devel - opment of our novel dictionary of n-grams — combinations of one or more words that capture specific themes or concepts — and the approach we used for our text-as-data analysis of the Korean media corpus. The following section presents the empirical results. Finally, we offer conclusions, discuss the limitations of this study, suggest directions for future research, and present the findings ’ theoretical, methodological and practical implications. 2.

Literature review: The entrepreneurial university and public engagement Universities ’ entrepreneurial activities and capability-building ef - forts are an increasingly important means of demonstrating their “ third mission ” of driving regional socio-economic development ( Borlaug & Elken, 2024; Etzkowitz, 1983; Uslu et al., 2019 ). In this article, the entrepreneurial university is understood as distinct from the traditional approach to tertiary education and research, aiming to foster entrepre - neurial activity and embody entrepreneurial capabilities among its staff, students, and alumni, along with partnerships with industry and gov - ernment ( ForlianoDe et al., 2021; Klofsten et al., 2019 ). Activities include entrepreneurial education and learning, research, service, spinouts, and technology transfer activities ( Etzkowitz & Zhou, 2021; Ozen et al., 2023 ). Cognate terms, and research streams, to the entre - preneurial university include “ academic entrepreneurship ” ( Goethner & Wyrwich, 2020 ), “ professorial entrepreneurship ” ( Kenney & Goe, 2004 ), “ university entrepreneurship ” ( Rothaermel et al., 2007 ), and research on the Triple Helix Model ( Etzkowitz, 1983 ) and “ academic engagement ” ( Perkmann et al., 2013 ). Scholars have shown that a key category of the university ’ s third mission includes public engagement activities, such as knowledge transfer, technology transfer, and entrepreneurship ( Benneworth et al., 2015; Borlaug & Elken, 2024; Etzkowitz, 1983 ). In this sense, the third mission is both the doing of entrepreneurial activities, but also, public engagement to shape local awareness, policy, and more. Research has revealed that by “ facilitating innovation/entrepreneurship and regional benefits, universities not only enhance their reputation but also the reputation of their university community ” ( Guerrero et al., 2016 ). Thus, in this article we understand the suite of entrepreneurship activities and their portrayal as collectively comprising the entrepreneurial university and the third mission. Despite the awareness of the need for this evaluation of public engagement as part of the entrepreneurial university, previous studies have tended to focus inwards, by assessing its efforts based upon pref - erences and activities of its community (e.g., alumni, staff, students). In a similar way, meta-synthesis and bibliometric studies of entrepre - neurial university research show that metrics center on data emanating from within the university ( Arroyabe et al., 2022; Uslu et al., 2019 ). In fact, Henry and Lahikainen refer to this inward focus as ‘intrapreneurial ’ orientations of the entrepreneurial university ( Henry & Lahikainen, 2024 ). Other studies analyze (longitudinal) cases — detailing missions, processes, and organizational changes — that employ quasi-experimental methods to ascertain performance on specific community members ( Etzkowitz et al., 2022 ). Other scholars conduct interviews with a range of internal stakeholders, including alumni, commercialization man - agers, faculty, management, and students to analyze what activities constitute the entrepreneurial university and their impact on partici - pants ( Dabic et al., 2015; Padilla-Mel ´endez et al., 2021 ). Quantitative studies draw on secondary sources for indicators of the university community ’ s entrepreneurial intentions and activities ( Lechuga Sancho et al., 2021 ), stock market data ( Audretsch & Lehmann, 2005 ), and social network analysis ( FusterPadilla-et al., 2019 ) to ascertain the entrepreneurial university ’ s impact on alumni, faculty, and students. Researchers also use surveys and questionnaires to measure the activ - ities, capabilities, intentions, and perceptions of members of the entre - preneurial university ( Ozen et al., 2023; Redondo & Camarero, 2019 ). In a disparate line of research, studies examine universities ’ growing public engagement activities, offering insight into the increasing num - ber and sophistication of channels used, as well as their performance ( Borlaug & Elken, 2024 ).

{"page_content": "teams that offer social media, video production, and traditional media capabilities ( Garner, 2017 ). Research at the intersection of science and public policy explores how universities’ scientific advances are communicated to wider society, particularly around salient issues such as climate change and health ( Retzbach & Maier, 2015; Tøsse, 2013; Winter 2004 ). Studies of social media as a platform for university marketing reveal both how these platforms are leveraged and how certain subjects (e.g., athletics) “perform” ( Peruta & Shields, 2018 ). The engagement of universities with the media has been analyzed from various disciplinary perspectives, including science and public policy ( Compagnucci & Spigarelli, 2020; Tøsse, 2013; Winter 2004 ) and marketing ( Peruta & Shields, 2018; Rutter et al., 2016 ). This body of literature examines the tools utilized, trends, and the efficacy of uni - versities’ public engagement efforts ( Rowe & Frewer, 2005 ). It high - lights campus leadership’s increasing desire to demonstrate their value ( Grant, 2021; Meek & Gianiodis, 2023; Shapiro, 2005 ), moving beyond the “ivory tower” critique ( Etzkowitz et al., 2000 ). It has revealed how university leadership has ramped up investments in public engagement ( Rutter et al., 2016 ). Communications and public relations (PR) teams have expanded to secure more and higher-quality media appearances as part of their efforts to demonstrate societal impact, enhance reputation, and support their rankings performance. Universities’ communications and PR teams are primarily respon - sible for two areas of engagement. One focuses on connecting individual researchers and teams with targeted audiences by organizing events such as roundtables with policymakers and forming partnerships with community groups. The initial goal is to engage key external stake - holders who can influence public policy and business decisions ( Cohen, 2022 ). Subsequently, other communication channels are used to convey this impact to a broader society. The second approach involves increasing media coverage, focusing on communicating the university’s impact to high-circulation newspapers, radio, television programs, and social media channels ( Peruta & Shields, 2018; Rutter et al., 2016 ). Universities’ communications teams engage with the media, especially high-circulation newspapers, through press releases and by pitching content to journalists. Thus, by ‘portrayed in the media’, this article refers to the university’s communications teams and public relations agencies that write press releases to communicate their portrayal directly, and journalists that write articles focused on universities’ entrepreneurial offerings. To facilitate these efforts, university leader - ship has invested in media training and staff experienced in PR, who have strong networks with journalists and possess pitching skills for the media ( Garner, 2017 ). In reaching broader society, the university aims to demonstrate a positive “town-gown relationship”, which refers to local community members recognizing the value that the university brings to its local region ( Bruning et al., 2006 ). This includes collaboration with local industry in specific domains, like smart specialization strategies ( Bukhari et al., 2021 ). Despite the advance of university efforts, some studies suggest that society may be “unresponsive to the efforts made by university staff” ( Compagnucci & Spigarelli, 2020 ) and that conveying scientific uncertainty can hinder public engagement efforts ( Retzbach & Maier, 2015 ). Therefore, while the growing investment by leadership in engaging with society at large is well-documented, there is a lack of evidence regarding the effectiveness of these efforts in raising societal awareness and perceived value. The question is not whether commu - nications have increased, but rather, what the portrayal of the university is. For instance, to what extent do universities’ communications center on students’ contributions to the regional economy, as revealed by Breznitz and co-authors ( Breznitz et al., 2022 )? We contend that the language used to portray activities is an essential factor in the efficacy of communications. Therefore, our first task is to deepen our understanding of the language used in media coverage. Emerging studies have started to explore the language used to describe the efforts of the entrepreneurial university and its third mission. Notably, Compagnucci and Spigarelli ( Compagnucci & Spigarelli, 2020 ) conducted a systematic review of journal articles regarding the third mission, and Forliano and co-authors ( ForlianoDe et al., 2021 ) analyzed the language of the entrepreneurial university through a bibliometric review of academic literature.

Studies have not examined the language used in media coverage of the entrepreneurial university. More broadly, the content of media communications related to the entrepreneurial uni - versity remains under-conceptualized and under-studied. 3. Theoretical framework: A sociological capital framework for understanding the language of the entrepreneurial university To investigate how the entrepreneurial university is portrayed in the media, we need to establish analytical expectations regarding the lan - guage used. We could operationalize the entrepreneurial university in terms of whether we refer to external or internal aspects ( Centobelli et al., 2019 ) or delineate them in terms of formal or informal factors ( Gordon et al., 2012 ). Our focus is on conveying efforts in terms of value-add, and so delineating in terms of these binaries do not seem optimal for describing impact or value. Thus, we turn to research that describes the entrepreneurial university in the language of the types of capital generated through its activities and the capabilities it cultivates ( Audretsch, 2007; Audretsch & Keilbach, 2004 ). There is a growing range of types of capital that are used to depict the entrepreneurial university and its environs. We conceptualize three foundational types of capital using an sociological capital framework: cultural, human, and social. These types of capital have been individu - ally and collectively explored in social science research, for an example on the types of capital and entrepreneurial performance ( Klingler-Vidra et al., 2021 ). Audretsch refers to this collectively as the ‘entrepreneurial capital’ of the university ( Audretsch, 2014 ). We considered codifying according to the additional categories that have been developed, espe - cially in the study of the entrepreneurial university. This includes ‘in - formation capital’ ( Rodionov et al., 2021 ), ‘knowledge capital’ ( Audretsch & Belitski, 2021; Rothaermel et al., 2007 ), and ‘intellectual capital’ which refers to the accumulation of human, relational and structural capital of the university in its local region ( Stewart, 1997; Trequattrini et al., 2018 ). While these are important concepts, our de - cision to focus on cultural, human, and social capital stems from their seminal status across social sciences research ( Becker, 1993; Bourdieu and Richardson, 1986; Coleman, 1988; Granovetter, 1973 ). These three types of capital provide a robust foundation for examining the entre - preneurial university’s societal value, offering (relatively, though imperfectly) distinct categories for analysis. While intellectual, infor - mation, or knowledge capital could indeed align with our research goals, incorporating additional types would risk further blurring the bound - aries of our analytical categories, making it more challenging to produce clear and meaningful insights. For example, intellectual and knowledge capital share significant conceptual similarities with human capital, which could lead to further redundancy in the interpretation of our data. These types of capital form the foundation of our analytical frame - work, which is based in the wider sociological capital tradition. Ac - cording to Bourdieu, cultural capital is distinct from economic, human and social capital. It has two forms that are particularly relevant in the educational context: the embodied state, which relates to “long-lasting dispositions of the mind and body,” and the objectified state, such as in pictures and books, which reflects these dispositions ( Bourdieu and Richardson, 1986 ). Becker defines human capital as investments in ed - ucation and training in both formal education and on-the-job training ( Becker, 1993 ). In contrast, social capital often refers to the contours and benefits of social networks ( Granovetter, 1973 ) and the “sociological glue” that underpins social trust in society ( Coleman, 1988", "metadata": {"producer": "Acrobat Distiller 8.1.0 (Windows)", "creator": "Elsevier", "creationdate": "2025-04-26T11:40:38+00:00", "crossmarkdomains[1]": "elsevier.com", "crossmarkmajorversiondate": "2010-04-23", "creationdate--text": "26th April 2025", "elsevierwebpdfspecifications": "7.0.1", "robots": "noindex", "moddate": "2025-04-26T12:21:30+00:00", "author": "Robyn Klingler-Vidra", "doi": "10.1016/j.techsoc.2025.102846", "title": "Communicating the societal value of the entrepreneurial university: Evidence from South Korea", "keywords": "Communication,Entrepreneurship,Human capital,Reputation,Social capital,Universities", "subject": "Technology in Society, 81 (2025) 102846. doi:10.1016/j.techsoc.2025.102846", "crossmarkdomains[2]": "sciencedirect.com", "crossmarkdomainexclusive": "true", "source": "data\\Communicating-the-societal-value-of-the-entrepreneurial-un_2025_Technology-i.pdf", "total_pages": 18, "page": 2, "page_label": "3", "start_index": -1}}

{"page_content": "how the entrepreneurial university portrays its (non-pecuniary) contri - bution to socio-economic development. We now discuss the three types in the entrepreneurial university research context. First, in the context of the entrepreneurial university, cultural capital is seen in terms of the promotion of shared values around entrepre - neurship, including attributes such as creativity, resilience, mindset, perseverance, problem-solving, and risk-taking ( Martínez-Martínez & Ventura, 2020 ). Culture has been examined in the entrepreneurial uni - versity context in terms of informal environmental factors, such as at - titudes ( Guerrero et al., 2016 ). This promotion occurs through activities such as the organization of clubs and events that cultivate attitudes fa - voring entrepreneurship, as well as universities ’ production of materials (often marketing materials) that reinforce these values ( Pittaway et al., 2011 ). Beyond the classroom, entrepreneurship clubs invite successful startup founders and venture capitalists to deliver guest talks, raising awareness of and admiration for entrepreneurship. Demonstrating how these values permeate the university in the contemporary era, research reveals that proximity, both spatially and through social networks, in - fluences entrepreneurship across universities ( Goethner & Wyrwich, 2020 ). These activities that aim to boost entrepreneurship-focused cul - tural capital go beyond the core education and research mechanisms. Rather than delivery through a degree program or lecture, or through research on the subject of entrepreneurship, it takes the shape of extracurricular clubs and events. Second, in the context of the entrepreneurial university, human capital is conceived as encompassing (formal) education and training, as well as research and commercialization activities that shape the com - munity ’ s knowledge and skills ( Dabic et al., 2015; Uslu et al., 2019 ). Academic entrepreneurship and entrepreneurship education are both forms of entrepreneurship-specific human capital, with a focus on aca - demic faculty and teaching ( Oosterbeekvan et al., 2010 ). Teaching (education and training) and research (knowledge creation exemplified by copyrights, patents, licenses, and trademarks) activities are seen as fostering entrepreneurial human capital within and beyond the uni - versity. Human capital activities constitute a core of the universities ’ offerings: degree programs and research, which in this case, are both focused on the theme of entrepreneurship. These modes are key to the university ’ s primary mission, not only a third mission. Third, social capital has been studied in the context of how the entrepreneurial university influences its community members ’ entre - preneurial intentions and performance ( Redondo & Camarero, 2019 ). Entrepreneurial universities promote networking activities, enhance professional social skills, and encourage community engagement ( Martínez-Martínez & Ventura, 2020 ). At the level of academic entrepreneurs and the broader faculty, this includes collaborations be - tween professors and university incubators with external firms ( Lee & Miozzo, 2019 ). Social capital has also been explored in the context of the social embeddedness fostered among professorial entrepreneurs ( Kenney & Goe, 2004 ). Klofsten and colleagues detail social networking activities that encompass coaching and mentorship provided by a wider set of community members, including “ alumni entrepreneurs, experi - enced volunteers, and professors with prior academic entrepreneurship experience ” ( Klofsten et al., 2019 ). The social capital elements comprise a mode that delivers bridge building within university communities and more widely, connecting the university with the broader (local) com - munity. This social engagement character speaks to the third mission aims of engaging wider society; in this context, through entrepreneurship-themed activities. These types of capital comprise language that refers to activities or capabilities. Audretsch and Keilbach and Siegel and colleagues both emphasize entrepreneurship as a set of activities, such as managing a startup and conducting R & D ( Audretsch & Keilbach, 2004; Siegel et al., 2007 ). These studies focus on the actions and tangible outcomes of ef - forts, rather than just the intention or ability to be a successful entre - preneur. In contrast, Centobelli and co-authors describe the entrepreneurial university as focusing on building capabilities and emphasize its intangible benefits — competence, intention, and poten - tial — rather than just the physical actions involved in becoming an entrepreneur ( Centobelli et al., 2019 ). In Table 1, we distill the types of capital into the language of activities (e.g., tangible interactions and spaces) and capabilities (e.g., intangible and potential). This allows us to evaluate how the entrepreneurial university is portrayed in media in terms of which resources are being accumulated (e.g., types of capital) and how (e.g., through activities or capability-building).

Just as in the seminal studies of the types of capital, within the literature on the entrepreneurial university, researchers have noted that each of the university ’ s domains can foster capital. Notably, Coleman ’ s Social capital in the creation of human capital ( Coleman, 1988 ), and Bourdieu ’ s The Forms of Capital, both critiqued Becker ’ s economic un - derstanding of educational attainment as too narrow ( Bourdieu and Richardson, 1986 ). These sociological capital scholars posited that learning produced, and was shaped by, other types of capital. In a similar way, entrepreneurship-focused university degrees provide stu - dents with the skills and knowledge of entrepreneurship, primarily constituting human capital. However, within the degree program, stu - dents also build their social networks, fostering social capital (which values entrepreneurship), which in turn increases cultural capital fa - voring entrepreneurship.

{"page_content": "relationship, Lechuga Sancho and colleagues describe how some uni - versity courses that focus on entrepreneurship foster cultural values in addition to skills (human capital) ( Lechuga Sancho et al., 2021 ). Networking events emphasize the intention to endow participants with expanded social capital. However, participants also learn from others in their network, and shared values can be developed in such interactions. Similarly, although incubators are chiefly seen as a form of on-the-job training and are therefore primarily centered on human capital, they also contribute to social capital in the form of relationships with external entities (bridging social capital) and internal contacts (bonding social capital) ( Redondo & Camarero, 2019 ). Thus, we categorize the activities of the entrepreneurial university as primarily, though not exclusively, facilitating the accumulation of either cultural, human, or social capital. Our engagement extends this sociological capital framework by exploring the relative thrust of entrepreneurial university media com - munications. As the study is, as far as we are aware, the first to evaluate the relative thrust of entrepreneurial university activities across the types of capital, we hope our conceptualization and initial empirical test helps to build analytical tools for future research into the relative weight of the different types. Here, we offer an initial analysis of what the thrust of media portrayal means given the entrepreneurial university’s posi - tioning in terms of its third mission. 4. Data and methods In this section we detail the analytical tools we developed to examine how the entrepreneurial university is depicted in the media. First, we created a novel corpus-based dictionary of n-grams to operationalize the concepts of entrepreneurial universities’ activities and capabilities, aligning with state-of-the-art dictionary generation methods ( Gentzkow et al., 2019; Prüfer & Prüfer, 2020; Rice & Zorn, 2021 ). Our dictionary is developed based on terms gathered from state-of-the-art literature on entrepreneurial universities (refer to Table A3 in the Appendix for a full list of sources). This dictionary approach addresses the call made by Klofsten and co-authors ( Klofsten et al., 2019 ) for broader assessments of universities’ impact, emphasizing the need to “collect appropriate data and also to define different levels of outcome success.” Our method for operationalizing the theoretical framework comprises the following steps. First, we conducted a Web of Science search for all articles published between January 2019 and April 2022 in the fields of business, eco - nomics, education, educational research, management, psychology, and social issues, with “entrepreneurial university” or “entrepreneurial universities” in the title. The Web of Science searches yielded 47 results for “entrepreneurial university” and 26 results for “entrepreneurial universities.” We reviewed the abstracts of the 73 articles. We identified those that presented theoretical frameworks and/or operationalization of the types of capital in the context of the entrepreneurial university and found that 19 out of the 73 articles discussed at least one of these types of capital. The chosen timeframe (2019–2022) aimed to capture the latest debates in the literature. To expand the range of studies included in the research, we also identified seminal studies on types of capital in the entrepreneurial university referenced in the 19 articles. Second, we manually coded the 19 articles based on the words used to describe cultural, human, and social capital. Each article was coded by at least two team members to ensure intercoder reliability. While conducting this term-gathering exercise, we identified an additional 15 cited articles that conceptualized the entrepreneurial university using at least one type of capital. To maintain intercoder reliability at this stage, two members of the research team independently coded these 15 articles for the words used to describe each type of capital. Upon completing the hand-coding of the 34 articles, we reached a point of saturation, where we no longer discovered new words and phrases in each additional article (for complete details of the 34 articles, refer to Appendix Table A3 ). The hand-coding stage generated 147 n-grams, consisting of 39 related to cultural capital, 61 to human capital, and 47 to social capital n-grams. Dictionary terms can be single words or terms composed of multiple words (e.g., bi-grams or tri-grams). Approximately 41% of the 147 n-grams describe human capital (e.g., “educate” and “research”), approximately 32% describe social capital (e.g., “institute” and “network”), and approximately 27% describe cultural capital (e.g., “environment” and “prize”). For n-grams where the primary category was coded differently by the two coders (e.g., “accelerator”), we sought external expert opinions from our network of practitioners (e.g., the university’s entrepreneurship institute head)", "metadata": {"producer": "Acrobat Distiller 8.1.0 (Windows)", "creator": "Elsevier", "creationdate": "2025-04-26T11:40:38+00:00", "crossmarkdomains[1]": "elsevier.com", "crossmarkmajorversiondate": "2010-04-23", "creationdate--text": "26th April 2025", "elsevierwebpdfspecifications": "7.0.1", "robots": "noindex", "moddate": "2025-04-26T12:21:30+00:00", "author": "Robyn Klingler-Vidra", "doi": "10.1016/j.techsoc.2025.102846", "title": "Communicating the societal value of the entrepreneurial university: Evidence from South Korea", "keywords": "Communication,Entrepreneurship,Human capital,Reputation,Social capital,Universities", "subject": "Technology in Society, 81 (2025) 102846. doi:10.1016/j.techsoc.2025.102846", "crossmarkdomains[2]": "sciencedirect.com", "crossmarkdomainexclusive": "true", "source": "data\\Communicating-the-societal-value-of-the-entrepreneurial-un_2025_Technology-i.pdf", "total_pages": 18, "page": 4, "page_label": "5", "start_index": 0}}

Third, we categorized our 147 n-grams based on their depiction of an activity (e.g., event, incubate, networking) or a capability that the uni - versity aims to develop (e.g., ecosystem, mindset, skill). This method of word-type categorization aligns frameworks used in previous studies of the entrepreneurial university ( Audretsch & Keilbach, 2004; Centobelli et al., 2019 ). This coding as activity or capability offers further insight into how the entrepreneurial university’s value is portrayed; either in terms of what occurs (e.g., activities) or the objectives (e.g., capabil - ities). See Appendix Table A2. Next, we enabled the empirical test by completing the following steps. We compiled the national media corpus to assess the frequency of the n-grams. We utilized Dow Jones Factiva to gather media coverage of South Korea’s 10 highest-ranked universities, as per the Times Higher Education rankings for 2022, spanning a 23-year period from 1998 to 2021. We note that the Quacquarelli Symonds (QS) World University Rankings 2022 have the same top 10 universities, except for one. Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology (GIST) is included, rather than Sejong University. It should be noted that Sejong University had just 121 media documents, which constitutes less than 2% of our corpus. See Appendix Table A1 for the list of included universities. Studies on Korea have focused on one or two universities. Our analysis began in 1998, coinciding with the East Asian Financial Crisis, a period in which entrepreneurship promotion surged in Korea ( Pacheco PardoKlingler- and Vidra, 2019 ). We collected media materials from the three highest-circulation English-language newspapers in the country: Korea JoongAng Daily, Korea Herald, and Korea Times. We performed searches using the uni - versity names as well as search strings containing their acronyms (KAIST, POSTECH, SKKU, SNU, and UNIST), within the timeframe of January 1, 1998, to December 31, 2021. We limited the search to “Headline and Lead Paragraph” to ensure that the coverage captured was substantively centered on the university. The media coverage encompassed articles that effectively served as press releases from the universities and articles in which university content was included in a journalist’s piece. This approach allowed us to investigate how the entrepreneurial university is portrayed in the media beyond the uni - versities’ official websites and social media accounts. This process yielded 7889 individual media documents, and you can find a list of the universities, their acronyms, and the number of search results in Ap - pendix Table A1. Our search was confined to English-language media coverage, which inherently has a somewhat limited reach in representing media portrayal to the wider Korean-speaking society compared to Korean- language newspapers. To mitigate this limitation, we adopted an approach used in state-of-the-art natural language processing studies of media data by selecting English-language newspapers that are affiliated with three decades-old prominent Korean-language newspapers with R.

We note that the English-language version may be written for a migrant and international audience, and thus not a pure translation, but rather emphasizing certain traits or activities. While acknowledging these issues, we note that our strategy of using English-language media coverage is consistent with practices employed in studies on East Asian media that have drawn upon English-language sources ( Klingler-VidraR and Chalmers, 2023; Massey & Chang, 2002 ). Due to the sensitivity of the natural language processing techniques, which focus on analyzing the use of specific terms, we accept this limitation rather than introducing judgement which would come from translating Korean into English. In accordance with the text-as-data techniques employed in research, we pre-processed our media corpus through a series of steps ( Prüfer & Prüfer, 2020 ). First, we organized the corpus by publication date, source, title, and university. Second, we eliminated all stop words (commonly occurring words such as “ and, ” “ for, ” and “ the ” ), punctua - tion, words containing three or more repeated letters, and all single-digit words (e.g., single-letter words) from the primary document text. Third, we normalized the dataset and our list of n-grams by stemming all remaining words (e.g., “ requires, ” “ requiring, ” “ required ” all become “ requir ” ). Our text-as-data analysis employs two techniques using the R pack - ages Quanteda and tidyr. The Quanteda package can be found at https://quanteda.io/ and the tidyr package can be found at https://cran. r-project.org/web/packages/tidyr/index.html. These packages have been used in state-of-the-art research ( Klingler-VidraR and Chalmers, 2023; Pagliari & Wilf, 2020 ). First, we assess the significance of cultural, human, and social capital n-grams for each news media article using two measures: (1) a count of the number of times each term appears in an article, with higher term frequencies indicating more occurrences in news coverage of the n-grams; and (2) the Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) score for each term per article. TF-IDF is a statistical measure that evaluates the importance of a word in a document relative to its frequency across a collection of documents. For example, if the word “ innovation ” frequently appears in a specific article but is rarely used in all other articles, its TF-IDF score is high, indicating its significance in that article. Next, we examine the “ co-location ” of capital n-grams and entre - preneurship terms within individual sentences in the same news article. This elucidates the degree to which the types of capital text is connected to language about entrepreneurship. To accomplish this, we establish a set of entrepreneurship terms: “ business creation, ” “ entrepreneur, ” “ enterprise, ” “ startup, ” and “ venture. ” We measure co-location through a pairwise correlation, which denotes the likelihood of types of capital n- grams appearing alongside entrepreneurship terms. The pairwise correlation method yields the Phi coefficient, a widely used measure for binary correlation. The Phi coefficient is calculated as: ϕ = n 11 n 10 \u0000 n 10 n 01 ̅̅̅̅̅̅ ̅ n 1* √ n 0* n 0* n 1. The Phi coefficient assists in assessing the probability of both X and Y appearing together, one appearing without the other, or neither appearing in an article. For instance, if every occurrence of “ applied research ” (a human capital n-gram) coincided with the term “ business creation ”, they would exhibit a high positive Phi coefficient. Essentially, Phi coefficients enable us to predict the likelihood of one term ’ s occurrence based on the occurrence of another term. The Phi coefficient ranges from \u0000 1 to 1, where 0 signifies no relationship, 1 denotes a perfect positive relationship, and \u0000 1 represents a perfect negative relationship. For our analysis, we examined the probability of entre - preneurship terms co-occurring with cultural, human, and social capital n-grams within the same sentence in the news articles.

{"page_content": "media corpus. In addition to the TF-IDF and pairwise correlation analyses, we completed a manual read of a subset of the articles to ascertain whether the results were consistent with our own intuition about the thrust of the piece. We initially read 10 articles to check whether the results of our quantitative analysis were robust. We conducted four more rounds of this random reading of articles until we were satisfied by the alignment between the NLP findings and our manual assessment of each article. In total, we read approximately 50 articles in this way before feeling suf - ficiently reassured that the text-as-data analysis was capturing what we intended. 5. Results and discussion Our analysis begins with an exploration of the frequency of cultural, human, and social capital n-grams in our corpus. The proportions of these n-grams from 1998 to 2021 are as follows: human capital emerges as the dominant category, accounting for 51% of all n-grams in our corpus (compared to its 41% representation). Following closely is social capital at 34%, with cultural capital n-grams making up 15%. Fig. 2 displays the proportions of cultural, human, and social capital n-grams annually over the 23-year period (1998 – 2021). The most notable observation in Fig. 2 is the consistent distribution of the types of capital over time. The relative share of human capital coverage persists, ranging from the highest proportion of 56% in 2006 to the lowest proportion of 42% in 2004, in comparison to social capital, which hovers around 30 – 40%, and cultural capital, which oscillates between 12% and 18%. Further examination of this distribution reveals standard deviations of 3.18 for human capital, 3.13 for social capital, and 1.8 for cultural capital. This suggests that the language of cultural capital is the least utilized over time, remaining relatively stable. Human capital is clearly the most prominent in the entrepreneurial university ’ s media portrayal over time. Still, there are questions about which language is most used within each type of capital. Figs. 3 – 5 employ heatmaps to visually depict the evolving significance of indi - vidual n-grams in the corpus based on their TF-IDF scores. Each row corresponds to an n-gram, while columns represent distinct time pe - riods. A darker color intensity indicates a higher TF-IDF score, signifying that an n-gram holds greater prominence during a specific time frame compared to other periods. Figures include only the top 15 n-grams in terms of TF-IDF scores. This visual representation facilitates the identi - fication of both the relative importance of specific n-grams within a given period and the shifting emphasis of these n-grams over time. We begin by examining the human capital n-gram heatmap. Fig. 3 reveals that the most frequently used terms are “ research, ” “ program, ” “ educate, ” “ lecture, ” and “ job ”, respectively. These human capital n-grams comprise the core university activities of education and research with an entrepreneurship flavor. This includes academic entrepreneurship activities, such as incubators and commer - cialization, as well as in the realm of entrepreneurship education, including the launch of degree programs explicitly focused on entre - preneurship. For example, a 2017 Korea JoongAng Daily article covering KAIST mentioned that the university operates “ a startup incubator, as well as K-School, a one-year master ’ s course that teaches the re - quirements for starting a business in collaboration with 19 departments ” ( Seo, 2017 ). Expressing their motivation, a professor at Hanyang Uni - versity stated in a 2017 interview with the Korea Herald that “ what we have to do now is to give the artificial intelligence industry a jump-start by advancing research, development, and commercialization ” ( Shin, 2017 ). Perhaps unsurprisingly, 11 of the 15 most-used n-grams (or 73%) are activity terms, whereas only four are capability n-grams. Collec - tively, this points to the predominant coverage of the entrepreneurial university in Korea as comprising education and research activities related to entrepreneurship. In this way, there is a core, or main, uni - versity mission character to this bulk of media communications. This does not necessarily convey its contribution to the university ’ s third mission, which is expected to be more about community engagement and regional socio-economic development ( Borlaug & Elken, 2024; Seri & Compagnucci, 2024 ).

{"page_content": "capabilities such as “ collaborations, ” “ links, ” and “ networks. ” In sum, coverage of the entrepreneurial university related to social capital em - phasizes activities and the physical spaces in which people meet, with less discussion of the capability-enhancing objectives of the efforts. The nature of the language used to describe the social capital domain for Korea ’ s entrepreneurial universities has more of a community and bridge-building character to it ( Bruning et al., 2006; Bukhari et al., 2021 ), which has more of a third mission character than the human capital lexicon did. In Fig. 5, which illustrates results related to cultural capital, n-grams such as “ culture, ” “ prize, ” “ promote, ” “ festival, ” and “ exhibition ” consistently stand out. Among these, “ culture ” emerges as the most dominant. Notably, it is the sole capability n-gram, whereas the other terms represent activities. Like human and social capital, the language of activity, rather than ca - pabilities, is most-used to portray the entrepreneurial university in the media. To provide insight into how these cultural capital n-grams appeared in media coverage, a senior leader at KAIST explained in a 2021 interview with Korea JoongAng Daily that his motivation for creating a startup program involving students visiting Silicon Valley stemmed from his eagerness to expose Korean students to that “ culture and mindset ” ( Park, 2021 ). Some news coverage, however, mentioned the capabilities that universities aimed to foster through activities. For instance, a 2017 news article covering Seoul National University explained that one of the participants was “ just one of many entrepre - neurs pitching their ideas ” and that “ they enthusiastically extolled the virtues of their startup ideas to their audience ” ( Jeong, 2017 ). In contrast to the human capital language, the cultural capital media coverage conveys interactions and wider shifts towards entrepreneurship, and more of a distinct third mission, going beyond education and research programming. Overall, the language of human capital is central to the portrayal of the entrepreneurial university in the media. This may reinforce the sense that the entrepreneurial university remains focused on its core education and research activities, rather than engaging in a wider array of formats to build bridges and drive mindset shifts. In short, the human capital prevalence may unwittingly convey the persistence of the university ’ s long-standing mission, and now its third mission of public engagement and driving socio-economic development through entrepreneurial ele - ments. It may reinforce concerns that the entrepreneurial university operates in an intrapreneurial way, rather than entrepreneurial ( Henry & Lahikainen, 2024 ). Having explored the prevalence of cultural, human, and social cap - ital n-grams in the news media, we now evaluate the likelihood of their co-occurrence with entrepreneurship terms. To achieve this, we examine pairwise correlations expressed as Phi coefficients, indicating the co- location of entrepreneurship language and cultural, human, and social capital n-grams. As mentioned earlier, this measures how much the presence of entrepreneurship terms in a sentence predicts the appearance of cultural, human, or social capital n-grams in the same sentence. Fig. 6 presents our findings (please also see Appendix A.4 for a more granular analysis of these variables). Each data point in the figure represents the Fig. 5. Top 15 cultural capital N-grams.

{"page_content": "mean Phi coefficient by year, categorized by cultural, human, and social capital types and distinguishing between activity and capability n-gram types. Fig. 6 reveals several trends. First, the likelihood of n-grams co- occurring with entrepreneurship terms is highest for human capital n- grams. Indeed, human capital n-grams exhibit a relatively high mean Phi coefficient (0.02) across all the years studied. Social capital demon - strates a similar pattern, with a mean Phi coefficient of 0.01; however, the mean Phi coefficient for cultural capital is notably lower, at \u0000 0.002. Said differently, the language of human capital appears most often, and closely, alongside entrepreneurship terms. This further augurs for the entrepreneurial university ’ s portrayal in education and research terms, rather than through other mechanisms that build bridges with external stakeholders and fosters mindset change. Furthermore, the results also reinforce TF-IDF findings that activity terms are used more often than the language of capabilities. Fig. 6 shows that activity terms have become more prevalent in human capital media coverage since approximately 2010. Around the same inflection point, however, capability terms became more prominent in media coverage of cultural and social capital n-grams. Further studies are needed to sys - tematically reveal the causes of this divergence. Here, we offer initial reflections about what may be driving the rise in activity language for human capital, but capabilities terms in coverage of cultural and social capital domains. The shift follows the election of Lee Myung-bak, who had previously served as the CEO of Hyundai Engineering and Con - struction and Mayor of Seoul. The onset of the Global Financial Crisis resulted in South Korean policymakers doubling down on encouraging entrepreneurial activity, including cooperation with universities along with government and big business, that had been initiated in the late 1990s. Structured degree courses were complemented with a rise in study tours and research exchanges aimed at cultivating an entrepre - neurial mindset. From 2013, Park Geun-hye announced her “ creative economy ” initiative, which encouraged risk-taking and an entrepre - neurial culture, with multiples clusters spread across the country ( Klingler-Vidra, 2020; Pacheco PardoKlingler- and Vidra, 2019; Park & Jeong, 2015 ). More research is needed to ascertain how the national political context may have influenced how universities ’ entrepreneurial efforts were affected. Collectively, policy may have oriented universities towards organizing entrepreneurial degrees and commercialization ac - tivities in an effort to enhance Korea ’ s wider entrepreneurial culture and related social networks. Finally, Fig. 6 shows an upward trajectory in the Phi coefficients for both human and social capital between 1998 and 2019, though this trend is less pronounced for cultural capital. Said another way, there has not been the same growth in media coverage of cultural capital activities and capabilities, despite the government ’ s Creative Economy push. The Phi coefficients for cultural capital tend to be predominantly negative, signifying that it is more likely for cultural capital n-grams to appear in the absence of entrepreneurship language. This reflects the prominence of cultural capital n-grams such as “ culture ” and “ promote ” in broader university discourse, not only in relation to entrepreneurship-focused efforts. Again, this suggests that relative to human and social capital, cultural capital is not as closely linked to the portrayal of the entre - preneurial university. The entrepreneurial university is portrayed as emphasizing education, research, centers and institutes, but less about fostering wider connections to catalyze an entrepreneurial culture, mindset, and greater risk-taking. The education and research flavors of entrepreneurship could be perceived as an extension of the university ’ s remit, and not necessarily in terms of a distinct third mission. 6. Conclusions and implications There is a paucity of research on how the entrepreneurial university is portrayed to the broader society. Does media portrayal of the entre - preneurial university showcase a widening spectrum of mechanisms and aims for engaging regional communities and economies? Or, is the entrepreneurial university portrayed as one that is delivering education and research activities with an entrepreneurship lens? The aim of this paper is to offer initial answers to these questions, by offering analytical tools, and an initial empirical test of how entrepreneurial university leadership are communicating their efforts to wider society. We discuss the theoretical, methodological, and practical implications in term. Theoretically, our findings advance the scholarly understanding of how the elements that constitute the entrepreneurial university relate to its third mission ( Benneworth et al., 2015; Borlaug & Elken, 2024; Compagnucci & Spigarelli, 2020 ). We advance a sociological capital framework to ground an analysis of what comprises the entrepreneurial university and how those domains — cultural, human and social capi - tal — align with the third mission.

Theoretically, our findings advance the scholarly understanding of how the elements that constitute the entrepreneurial university relate to its third mission ( Benneworth et al., 2015; Borlaug & Elken, 2024; Compagnucci & Spigarelli, 2020 ). We advance a sociological capital framework to ground an analysis of what comprises the entrepreneurial university and how those domains — cultural, human and social capi - tal — align with the third mission. We find that human capital activities are the most frequently reported. In this way, the portrayal of the (Korean) entrepreneurial university ’ s value to wider society emphasizes the university ’ s core education and research activities, not necessarily its contribution to boosting social networks and mindsets that encourage entrepreneurship. Even in the Korean case, where national policy has emphasized the importance of a creative economy since 2013, entre - preneurial universities spoke about culture, grit, mindset and risk taking relatively less than core education and research activities. Given societal scrutiny over the public value of universities, is this human capital ac - tivity focus ideal, or even sufficient for showcasing efforts to deliver on the third mission? The centrality of human capital language may rein - force the entrepreneurial university in its traditional terms; centering on education and learning for its own community. The portrayal is not one that emphasizes bridge-building and the cultivation of entrepreneurial mindsets. to convey the breadth of the third mission and its broader impact on socio-economic development. Methodologically, we extend work by emerging studies that have begun exploring the language used to describe the efforts of the entre - preneurial university and its third mission. Notably, we contribute to recent state-of-the-art research by Compagnucci and Spigarelli ( Compagnucci & Spigarelli, 2020 ) and Forliano and co-authors ( ForlianoDe et al., 2021 ) who conducted text-based analyses of the language used in academic research to describe the entrepreneurial university. These studies offer insight into knowledge of the entrepre - neurial university, but not whether this same language is used in external communications. We contribute by operationalizing a dictio - nary for analyzing the language used by universities, particularly in how they portray their entrepreneurial university activities to wider society. In addition, we contribute by offering an initial set of analytical ex - pectations for the relative emphasis on cultural, human and social capital in the entrepreneurial university ’ s portrayal. Finally, these findings have practical implications for university leadership teams. By uncovering how the entrepreneurial university is portrayed, leaders can critically assess whether these human capital- centric portrayals align with their strategic intentions. Understanding the current narrative allows leadership to refine key aspects of their communications strategy, such as making a concerted effort to run stories about promoting networking opportunities and fostering wider society ’ s entrepreneurial mindset, or intentionally weaving more lan - guage about capability-building into coverage of events and institute R.

{"page_content": "news. If university leadership aim to boost the perception that they are contributing to local communities in increasingly diverse, innovative ways, then communications teams can make a concerted effort to use this engagement language, rather than the more traditional education and research lexicon. In addition to reconsidering communications, these insights offer an opportunity to potentially reshape the uni - versity ’ s entrepreneurial offerings. This approach supports the scholarly call for university leaders to actively manage the entrepreneurial uni - versity model ( Guerrero et al., 2024; Leih, 2016; Meek & Gianiodis, 2023 ), ensuring it delivers meaningful value to both the institution and wider society. This is especially important given the acknowledgements of the tensions and limited resources that university leadership teams face ( Benneworth et al., 2015 ). In short, the findings raise questions about the extent to which, and ways in which, current programs of entrepreneurship are delivering on the strategic objectives of this third mission. There are some limitations to our approach. First, as discussed in the Data and methods section, due to the sensitivity of the analysis to lan - guage, our n-grams are restricted to English-language analysis (this was also in line with recent state-of-the-art studies of media coverage using NLP techniques ( Klingler-VidraR and Chalmers, 2023; Massey & Chang, 2002 )). Future research should aim to adapt the n-grams for studies in other languages. Second, while we aimed to expand our geographical coverage beyond the European and North American contexts by exam - ining the case of South Korea, this study focuses on a single country, which entails a trade-off between external validity and internal validity. Nonetheless, the depth of our analysis of the Korean context, encom - passing a long timeframe (20 years) and a multitude of universities (10), provides robust internal validity. Conducting research in other empirical contexts will elucidate the extent to which our findings apply to broader phenomena, consequently enhancing external validity. Future studies should investigate whether media coverage in other contexts similarly emphasize human capital activities. Third, this study serves as an initial endeavor to codify a dictionary representing the activities and capabil - ities of the entrepreneurial university in cultural, human, and social capital terms. While we have confidence in the robustness of our hand-coding process based on state-of-the-art literature ( Gentzkow et al., 2019; Prüfer & Prüfer, 2020 ), it is inevitable that there will be advancements in refining the dictionary used to analyze the language of the entrepreneurial university in the future. We anticipate that future research can employ our dictionary to provide fresh insights into the content and effectiveness of public engagement by entrepreneurial universities. Researchers can utilize this dictionary to analyze media coverage of entrepreneurial university ac - tivities and capabilities in various national contexts and make compar - ative assessments across sets of universities. Studies could also examine the relationship between national policies, such as Korea ’ s Creative Economy Action Plan, and universities ’ media portrayal. They may also explore other text sources. In addition to analyzing national media, future studies can examine social media to investigate how society in - teracts with entrepreneurial universities. Conducting sentiment analysis on media data can help gauge perceived value. This approach would establish a connection between what the university communicates and societal perceptions of its contribution to the local community. It would offer the crucial assessment of whether the public sees, and values, a distinct third mission.

To do this we employed a simple Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression model. The regression equation is as fol - lows. Phi = β 0 + β 1(Type) + β 2(Capital: Human) + β 3(Capital: Social) + ϵ. In this model, Phi is the dependent variable, representing the outcome we aim to predict, namely the likelihood of the co-occurrence of two n-gram sets. The equation includes an intercept, β 0, which is the constant term. Each independent variable has its own coefficient: β 1 represents the effect of the dummy variable for Type, while β 2 and β 3 are the coefficients for Capital: Human and Capital: Social, respectively. Finally, ϵ epsilon ϵ is the error term, capturing the variance in Correlation not explained by the independent variables in the model. This model is appropriate because the dependent variable, Phi, is continuous, with a mean of 0.0098, a standard deviation of 0.0836, and a range from \u0000 0.176 to 1. Additionally, both independent variables (Type and Capital) are factor variables, allowing OLS to estimate the linear relationships between each category and the dependent variable effectively. The model provides unbiased estimates, making it suitable for analyzing how variation across categories of Type and Capital relates to changes in Phi. The results, presented in Table A4. Based on the regression results, the coefficient for Type: Capability is 0.003, indicating a small positive asso - ciation with the dependent variable, Phi, relative to the base category of Activity. However, this effect is not statistically significant. For Capital, Human Capital shows a positive and statistically significant effect on Phi with a coefficient of 0.02 (SE = 0.002, p < 0.001), suggesting that Human Capital is associated with an increase in Phi compared to the base category Cultural Capital. Similarly, Social Capital has a positive and statistically significant effect, with a coefficient of 0.01 (SE = 0.02, p < 0.001), indicating that it also positively impacts Phi relative to Cultural Capital. The constant term is \u0000 0.004 (SE = 0.001, p < 0.01), showing the expected value of Phi when all predictors are at their ‘baseline levels. These findings align with findings obtained through other analysis pre - sented in Fig. 6. First, the predicted impact on Phi coefficients is consid - erably higher for human capital and social capital compared to cultural capital. Second, while capability n-grams have a slightly larger predicted impact on Phi coefficients compared to activity terms, these differences are small and, furthermore, not statistically significant when considering 95% confidence intervals. Collectively, our different results point to the predominance of human capital, relative to social and cultural capital, and the relative dominance of activity language, rather than capabilities. R.

Phasing out this reliance is considered important as the UK ’ s ‘Net-Zero ’ ambitions. Alternatives to a reliance on natural gas, include the use of hydrogen boilers and electri - fication using heat pump technologies. The acceptance of these technologies among different societal actors (including publics) will play a significant role in which are backed, available, and used. The aim of this study was to consider the perceptions of key stakeholders in the UK residential heat decar - bonisation sector about: (a) policies pertaining to this sector; (b) the factors likely to shape public acceptance of hydrogen and heat-pump technologies; and (c) the prospect of repurposing the gas pipeline network to support heat decarbonisation. Interviews were held with 12 stakeholders from the UK ’ s residential heating sector. In - terviews were supported using bespoke ‘flash cards ’ to convey core details about each of the options under consideration. Interview principally considered the relative strengths and drawbacks of hydrogen versus ‘standard ’ heat pump options, with discussions centring on four primary themes: Relative risks and benefits; Public choice and control over residential heating options; Engaging with the public throughout the energy transition; and Envi - sioning future energy transition scenarios for residential home heating. The findings confirm that the factors and actors feeding into the relative ‘acceptability ’ of each option are manifold, and that the ‘acceptance ’ of each option is tied to factors, such as: (a) the consistency of policy signals from government; (b) the relative affordability of the technology; and (c) both the physical infrastructure and social aspects of the local development context. The concept of repurposing the gas pipeline network was considered to be a good idea in principle, although enthusiasm was heavily caveated with reference to the practicalities of achieving this goal. 1. Introduction In 2022, the UK ’ s residential sector is estimated to have been responsible for about 17% of all national carbon dioxide emissions ( Committee on Climate Change, 2022; Department for Energy Security and Net Zero, 2024 ). This makes the decarbonisation of the residential sector a crucial step in meeting the UK ’ s aspirations of becoming a ‘Net Zero ’ economy by 2050 (UK Committee on Climate Change, 2020; Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, 2021 ). With around 85% of UK households currently using natural gas (methane) for space and water heating (Department for Business, Energy and Indus - trial Strategy, 2018), phasing out a reliance on gas for these purposes is considered a key part of the equation ( BEIS, 2022; Committee on Climate Change, 2019; Eyre & Baruah, 2015; Salite et al., 2024; Slorach & Stamford, 2021 ).

{"page_content": "residential heating, this qualitative, semi-structured interview study considers the perspectives of 12 residential-heating sector experts (i.e. ‘practitioners ’ ) about: (a) UK policies for residential heat decarbon - isation; (b) the factors shaping public (intentions to) uptake and use hydrogen and heat-pump technologies; and (c) the repurposing of the natural gas pipeline network to support the use of hydrogen and augmented heat pump technologies (aligned with the GasNetNew project). 1.1. UK residential sector decarbonisation The last 20 years has seen successive UK governments set out a range of policy interventions, communication strategies and financing mea - sures, designed to transform and decarbonise the residential sector (e.g., Daruwada et al., 2022; Royapoor et al., 2023; Cotton et al., 2024 ). This has included, among other initiatives (e.g., the decarbonisation of electricity networks), public outreach campaigns focused on demand reduction and household energy retrofit schemes. Due to their ability to conserve energy and alleviate fuel poverty, as well as support other social and economic policy objectives, there is a clear justification for investing in programmes of household energy retrofit ( Kerr et al., 2017 ). Over the past two decades, UK government-backed schemes (including public incentivisation schemes) have been introduced to encourage the uptake and installation of energy efficiency measures (e.g., insulation), micro-generation technologies, and low-carbon heating options (e.g., heat pumps) in people ’ s homes ( Kerr & Winskel, 2020; Carter & Pearson, 2024; Salite et al.2024). These include the Feed in Tariffs Scheme, the Green Deal, the Community Energy Saving Programme, and the Boiler Upgrade Scheme, to name but a few (see Brown et al., 2024, for a summary of the UK policy context). However, uptake and delivery of some of these public incentivisation schemes and home energy retrofit initiatives has remained low for various reasons, including ‘eligibility-readiness gap ’ (i.e., the difference between the number of households deemed to be eligible for support compared to the number that are actually ready to receive the tech - nology), a scarcity of skilled and qualified installers, and low levels of public awareness of and motivation to engage with such schemes ( Castaneda et al., 2020; Elsharkawy & Rutherford, 2018; Jenner et al., 2013; Lamb & Elmes, 2024 ). Ongoing (and future) attempts to decar - bonise the residential sector will thus require more efforts to better understand the mix of factors (e.g., funding availability, infrastructural readiness) and actors (e.g., installers, publics) that drive or inhibit the uptake of innovation in this sector ( Selvakkumaran & Ahlgren, 2019; Royapoor et al., 2023 ). A significant part of the UK ’ s ‘issue ’ around residential sector decarbonisation is the continuing heavy reliance on natural gas for water and space heating. Two of the primary alternatives to natural gas being considered in the UK are: (1) the electrification of heating via an expanded use of heat pumps; and (2) the use of hydrogen as either a partial (i.e. blended) or complete substitute for natural gas in domestic boilers. Heat pumps are used to extract energy principally from air, ground or water-sources, allowing for it to be used for the purposes of space and water heating ( Gaur et al. 2022 ). Heat pumps sit alongside other forms of electrification, including the use of electric resistance heaters and electric storage heaters. Previous research has provided insight into the relative advantages and disadvantages of these two low-carbon alternatives for residential heating with regard to their practical viability, output quality, safety, and performance ( Fern ´andez-Dacosta et al., 2019; Acar et al., 2019; Gaur et al. 2022; Bartela et al., 2022 ). As in -depth review is beyond the scope of this article, we have instead provided a summary of the key advantages and disadvantages of each option is provided in Table 1. In the face of ongoing policy and technological innovation in the sector (e.g., solar assisted thermochemical heat pump technologies) and in the wake of some failed large-scale demonstration hydrogen projects (e.g., Whitby ‘Hydrogen Village ’ ), there remain questions about the relative social acceptability of these technologies.

Although viewed by some as an important energy carrier in a future decarbonized world, sometimes promoted as pro - ducing low carbon dioxide emissions, controversy remains around blue hydrogen with many (e.g., Hannan et al., 2025; Howarth & Jacobson, 2021; Noussan et al., 2021; Pingkuo & Junqing, 2024 ) questioning how green it truly is. Furthermore, there remains a high number of unsolved issues relating to blue hydrogen, including technical challenges, eco - nomic and geopolitical implications which can influence people ’ s social acceptance of this alternative technology ( Gordon et al., 2022, 2024 ). Nonetheless, like all alternative technologies (e.g., heat pumps) aimed towards achieving residential decarbonisation there is a greater need to have a clearer vision on ways societies can transition to low-carbon residential technologies (e.g., hydrogen, and heat pumps) which are based on a broader global perspective ( Noussan et al., 2021 ). The current study forms part of the GasNetNew project, an interdis - ciplinary research programme designed to help support residential decarbonisation in the UK. In addition to modelling residential heating demand, GasNetNew project is developing thermochemical and water- Table 1 Advantages and disadvantages of the use of hydrogen and heat pumps as al - ternatives to natural gas for residential sector heating. Option Advantages Disadvantages Hydrogen ● Potential of repurposing the natural gas grid. ● With further investment and economies of scale, costs of producing and supplying hydrogen energy can be brought down, with green hydrogen potentially becoming cost-competitive with natural gas by 2030. ● There are potential other markets for hydrogen, e.g. within the industry sector. ● It allows the ‘disused underground salt caverns may be used for seasonal storage of the hydrogen. ● With the growth in renewable sources (for H2 generation) and with more storage capacity, payback times for investment in hydrogen technologies will reduce. ● Once installed in people ’ s homes, boiler units should operate ‘like-for-like ’ with natural gas boilers. ● Within a closed environment (like a house) there is a slightly higher risk of leaks with hydrogen than natural gas at present. ● More research is needed to understand the benefits and risks of using hydrogen in certain types of industrial processes, domestic properties and buildings. ● Carbon dioxide emissions are a by-product of some forms of hydrogen production. For example, when using steam reformation to produce hydrogen from fossil fuels. ● Hydrogen has a wider range of flammable concentrations in air and lower ignition energy than gasoline or natural gas, which means it can ignite more easily, posing a risk. Heat pumps ● Heat pumps are relatively safe, assuming good design and proper installation. They do not heat water to near- boiling temperatures. ● Air and ground-source heat pumps will reduce carbon emissions depending on the source of electricity used to power them. ● Upfront capital and installation costs to the consumer are offset by lower running costs compared with traditional gas-heating systems. ● The electricity grid upgrades required to support the installation in an individual house can take 4 weeks to complete. ● Payback periods can vary, but on average they start from 10 years plus. ● More research is needed to understand the safe use of chemical source heat pumps in certain types of domestic properties and buildings. ​ *All information is collated from Fern ´andez-Dacosta et al.

{"page_content": "source heat exchangers to support residential heat pump technologies ( Famigliett et al., 2023 ). Associated with this, the project is examining how the legacy natural gas pipeline network in the UK could be used to either extract hydrated thermochemical solutions from households (supporting thermo-chemically assisted heat pumps); or transport non-potable water to households (supporting water-source heat pumps). Another branch of GasNetNew project is researching the potential for parts of the gas pipeline network to be used for adiabatic compressed air energy storage (CAES) (see Bartela et al., 2022 ). The remainder of this introduction outlines the importance of considering the social accep - tance of innovations in residential heat decarbonisation (another key facet of the GasNetNew project) before outlining the specific focus on the current study in this regard. 1.2. The importance of assessing social acceptance A key determinant of the success of technology and policy in - terventions is whether they are deemed to be ‘acceptable’ and are thus ‘accepted’ by societal actors. Studies into the social acceptance of emerging energy technologies have thus increasingly become a part of the research and development cycle ( Boudet, 2019; Ingeborgrud et al., 2020; Jones et al., 2017 ). Understanding about the concept of social acceptance continues to develop (Windemer, 2023), however, promi - nent theoretical frameworks tend to agree that it should be treated as multi-actor and multi-level ( Devine-Wright et al., 2017; Upham et al., 2015 ). Several frameworks, for instance, delineate between acceptance at the macro (e.g. societal, national), meso (e.g. community, regional) and micro (e.g. household) scale and among key actor groups, including policy actors, publics and ‘other’ stakeholders ( Gordon et al., 2022 ). The ‘other’ stakeholders tend to include business and industry, academic, NGOs, and charitable organisations, among others. It is the attitudes, actions and interactions among these different actor groups at different scales, which can ultimately determine the acceptability and societal readiness for the introduction of a new technology ( Gordon et al., 2022 ). There is a growing literature that speaks to the nature and de - terminants of the social acceptance of residential sector heating in - novations, including the uptake and use of heat pumps and hydrogen. This has included studies focused on perspectives at the macro level (i.e. acceptance ‘in principle’), as well as at the meso- and micro-levels relating to their community and household-scale deployment ( Gordon et al., 2022; Scovell, 2022; Thomas et al., 2024 ). The extant research in this space has begun to identify some of the key barriers to engagement in demand response initiatives relevant to heat pumps and the uptake of low-carbon energy options among UK households. Demand response is a program that encourages households to use less electricity during peak hours by adjusting their heat pump usage, thus reducing strain on the power grid ( Barani et al., 2024; Chantzis et al., 2023; Crawley et al., 2021 ). For instance, Parrish et al. (2020) in a systematic review of consumer engagement with residential demand response initiatives, identified a range of important factors. Positive drivers for enrolment included the anticipated environment and (more importantly) financial benefits, and barriers included a lack of familiarity with the concept of demand response and mistrust in the motivations of the organisers of schemes. Other factors included the beliefs about the extent to which demand response would facilitate (rather than disrupt) existing household routines, the perceived complexity and effort required to engage with the schemes, and the anticipated risks (e.g. less predictable pricing, technical issues) and reduced control by users ( Barani et al., 2024 ). The importance of the concepts of trust and financial consequences were also evident in work by Gordon et al. (2024) in relation to the use of hydrogen for residential heating. In a series of 10 online focus groups with members of the public, they explored the acceptability of the UK hydrogen transition at the macro-, meso, and micro levels. This study highlighted a trust deficit in government and energy suppliers and the associated need to ensure fairness and equity across different communities in the pursuit of heat decarbonisation and Net Zero (see also Dillman & Heinonen, 2022 ). It also demonstrated that there was an openness to switching to hydrogen, this was contingent on there being a ‘price pledge’ on energy bills to assist with the transition (e.g. to assist with appliance purchases). While studies into the opinions of publics towards the low-carbon residential energy transition (e.g. in their role as householders and/or prospective recipients or consumers or", "metadata": {"producer": "Acrobat Distiller 8.1.0 (Windows)", "creator": "Elsevier", "creationdate": "2025-04-26T11:40:38+00:00", "crossmarkdomains[1]": "elsevier.com", "crossmarkmajorversiondate": "2010-04-23", "creationdate--text": "26th April 2025", "elsevierwebpdfspecifications": "7.0.1", "robots": "noindex", "moddate": "2025-04-26T12:34:12+00:00", "author": "V.

It also demonstrated that there was an openness to switching to hydrogen, this was contingent on there being a ‘price pledge’ on energy bills to assist with the transition (e.g. to assist with appliance purchases). While studies into the opinions of publics towards the low-carbon residential energy transition (e.g. in their role as householders and/or prospective recipients or consumers or technology) have grown rapidly, there has been comparatively less focus on eliciting the opinions of other social stakeholders. This is in spite of their potential to offer informed and/or different perspectives on energy transitions, including in relation to how publics might think and behave in relation to new technologies ( Ercan et al., 2024 ). For example, in relation to residential heating, Lowes and Woodman (2020) following semi-structured interviews with experts in UK heat policy (including a politician, political advisors, industry-based policy experts, and civil servants), concluded that policy makers view heat decarbonisation as fundamentally disruptive, partic - ularly for consumers, with little up-side. Among the policy implications stemming from their study, they highlight how the prospects of disruption and increasing energy costs for consumers might limit the political will to deliver on heat decarbonisation policy, particularly among politicians seeking re-election. Relatedly they advocate for the pursuit of further, low-risk trials (e.g., in off-grid communities) to help reduce uncertainty around technologies and approaches while also affording opportunities to learn about how best to limit consumer disruption. In another study, based upon 58 semi-structured interviews with ‘practitioners’ (e.g., industry professionals, policy experts, civil servants, etc.), householders with a shared loop ground-source heat pump, and householders without a heat pump; Brown et al. (2024) reflect upon public attitudes towards GSHPs (and associated financial support mechanisms), as well as the wider policy, governance and financing requirements required to expand the implementation of this technology. In their conclusions they champion the need for stronger policies around heat decarbonisation (e.g. to give greater certainty to developers) and highlight the key role that local authorities should play in delivering projects - as trusted and empowered intermediaries (provided they are given appropriate funding and capacity to deliver). They also highlight the need for a government backed training and testing centre to upskill qualified fitters to deliver on the ambitious heat decarbonisation pro - grammes. An interesting finding from this study was the apparent discrepancy in concerns over disruption to consumers. While the prac - titioners perceived this to be a significant barrier to deployment (akin to Lowes & Woodman, 2020 ), the householders were found to be fairly accepting of such disruption, considering it akin to other forms of infrastructure disruption. These and other studies ( Gordon et al., 2022; Thomas et al., 2024 ) not only begin to highlight emerging trends in the drivers of the social acceptance (or rejection) of residential decarbonisation options (e.g., the need to ensure appropriate financing for schemes and assurances for consumers, the need to employ trusted intermediaries to deliver schemes), but also attest the value of assessing the viewpoints of a range of stakeholders, including ‘practitioners’ when seeking to more fully understand the motivations, enablers and barriers to residential sector decarbonisation. 1.3. Aim of the current study The aim of this study was to consider the perceptions of key stake - holders (‘practitioners’) in the UK residential heat decarbonisation sector about: (a) policies pertaining to this sector; (b) the factors likely to shape public acceptance of hydrogen and heat-pump technologies; and (c) the prospect of repurposing the gas pipeline network to support heat decarbonisation.

This study ’ s findings are therefore considered novel in that they could stimulate design transformations that are derived bottom-up and may be engage in in-depth discussions and interrogations of the technologies offered. The current study employed 12 semi-structured interviews to explore ‘practitioner ’ perspectives on the viability of different technologies for decarbonising household heating in the UK. Our interview schedule focused on eliciting interviewees ’ perspectives on the use of hydrogen and ‘regular ’ heat pumps, as well as the ‘augmented ’ heat pump options and CAES being considered within the XXXX project. Specifically, interview discussions centred around four primary themes: (1) Relative risks and benefits; (2) Public choice and control over residential heating options; (3) Engaging with the public throughout the energy transition; and (4) Envisioning future energy transition scenarios for residential home heating. Qualitative interviewing is a common method for exploring stakeholder perceptions of innovative energy technologies, and has been used successfully in other recent studies pertaining to the decarbonisation of energy systems ( Hoseinpoori et al., 2023; Thomas et al., 2024 ). It can provide a rich and nuanced picture of interviewees ’ opinions that can otherwise be lost with a reliance on more quantitative or economic tools (e.g. cost-benefit analysis and modelling techniques). 2. Methodology 2.1. Population sample and recruitment process Interviewees were recruited using a selection criterion to ensure the population sample represented a diverse range of stakeholder views. Interviewees were selected to represent from six target groups with an interest or involvement in residential sector heating UK (‘practitioners ’ ): grid operators, policy advisors, energy providers, industry professionals, energy-focused consumer bodies, and academics. Prospective in - terviewees that met this selection criteria ( n = 41) were identified via desktop research (e.g., via Google search and contacts within project team) and subsequently approached via email with an invitation to participate in an interview, as part of the initial selection process. Of the 41 people approached, 12 agreed to being interviewed (29.2% response rate). The interviewees interviewed represented the following six target groups: grid operators ( n = 1), policy advisors providing decarbonised energy advice to UK businesses ( n = 3), energy providers ( n = 2), in - dustry professional in a strategic advisory role ( n = 1), energy-focused consumer bodies ( n = 3), and academics researching decarbonised en - ergy options ( n = 2). All interviews were conducted online (via Zoom) between July and October 2023. Interviews ranged in length between 35 and 90 min (Mean duration: 51 min) and were conducted with one interviewee at a time. All interviews were audio-recorded and subse - quently transcribed prior to analysis. 2.2. Materials and procedure The project was subject to appropriate ethical review at the Uni - versity of XXXX (Ref: SHFEC 2023-062). Before commencing the inter - view, participants were provided with an information sheet about the study and asked to sign a consent form. The interview schedule was developed with reference to themes prominent within the literature pertaining to social acceptance of residential sector decarbonisation. The full list of questions can be found in the Supplementary Materials. The interview was broadly structured as follows: 1. Preliminary questions: Interviewees were asked about their organi - sation and their role within the organisation, and their familiarity with the UK residential heating sector. Interviewees were also asked to reflect on their opinion of the current trends towards residential sector decarbonisation through the replacement of gas boilers with heat-pumps, and the trials using hydrogen as a full or partial replacement for natural gas. 2. Discussion of the technology options: All interviewees were then invited to think about the future, where natural gas had been phased out and was no longer used in residential heating. In this context, they were invited to consider the relative costs, risks, benefits and overall social acceptability of six technology options: (i) hydrogen; (ii) air-source heat pumps; (iii) ground-source heat pumps; (iv) heat pumps sup - ported by a water-source heat exchanger; (v) heat pumps supported by a thermochemical heat exchanger; and (vi) compressed air energy storage (CAES). The study did not include heat networks as a further alternative technology option as the existing gas network pipes are not entirely well suited for conversion into district heat as they are not well insulated (e.g., the soil temperature will be lower than the heat network). Instead, we selected those alternative technology options where the gas network with as little change as possible.

To assist interviewees in the process of making comparisons, they were each provided with a series of ‘flash cards ’ to look through (outlined below). Each card provided a brief description of one of the six op - tions alongside expert-evaluations of that option in terms of its per - formance against seven criteria (e.g., investment payback time, carbon abatement potential). 3. Recommendations for the future: Interviewees were finally asked to outline their personal recommendations for the future of decarbon - ising UK residential heating. In doing so, they were invited to consider the utility of the options provided within the interview, as well as making any more general recommendations or comments. All interviewees were then thanked for their time and dismissed. 2.2.1. Flash cards Information cards (‘flash cards ’ ) containing brief details about each technology option to be considered within the interview were prepared and provided to interviewees. The use of flash cards (or ‘cue cards ’ ) has a long history within qualitative research, helping to challenge existing ways of thinking and open-up conversations by overcoming shyness or reticence, and by giving participants greater control over aspects of the research process ( Harada & Waitt, 2024 ). The flash cards were devel - oped in association with the diverse group of chemical, mechanical and design engineers that make up the project team. Fig. 1 provides an example of one of the flash cards (i.e. the Hydrogen flash card). All the flash cards developed and used in the study available in the Supple - mentary Materials. The flash cards had a dual purpose within the interview: (1) to ensure that interviewees were more familiar with the technologies under discussion, so as to elicit more informed opinions; and (2) to be provocative, such that interviewees would actively weigh-up and critique the options. As such, we were open to dispute about the information on the cards, to the extent that this provided an opportunity to more fully explore interviewee perspectives on the comparative strengths and weaknesses of the different options. The flash cards took a comparative ‘Top Trumps ’ style format. ‘Top Trumps ’ is a card game where objects (e.g., animals) are rated against a common set of criteria (e.g., speed or strength). ’ The higher the score the object receives for each criterion, the better the object is judged to be for that purpose; an overall judgement can also be made based on the combined scores. This ‘Top Trumps ’ style approach has been utilised successfully in prior research designed to gain informed perspectives on emerging energy technologies, including carbon dioxide utilisation ( Jones et al., 2014 ) and heat decarbonisation ( Thomas et al., 2024 ). In the current context, the six technology options were introduced and evaluated against seven criteria: (i) investment payback time; (ii) mar - ket potential; (iii) carbon reduction or abatement potential; (iv) safety; (v) cost benefit to the consumer; (vi) date to commercial viability; and (vii) ability to promote ‘business as usual ’ operations. Outline de - scriptions of these seven criteria are provided in Table 2. Each criterion (except for commercial availability, which was estimated in years) was provided with an ‘expert rating ’ on a scale of 0 – 10, with higher scores equivalent to a better assessment on that criterion (e.g., greater strength, V.

All the stakeholder interview discussions were transcribed and analysed using inductive six-phased framework as outlined by Braun and Clarke (2006) (i.e., data familiarisation, initial code generation, search for key themes and sub-themes, review of themes and sub-themes, final definition of themes and subthemes, and write-up). This approach is commonly used to categorise and link prominent themes and opinions within qualitative data, allowing for meaning to be negotiated, codified and presented ( Williams & Moser, 2019 ). 3. Findings Four primary themes were identified from the interview transcripts: (1) Relative risks and benefits; (2) Public choice and control over resi - dential heating options; (3) Engaging with the public throughout the energy transition; and (4) Envisioning future energy transition scenarios for residential home heating. Central to the practitioner discussions was the critical appraisal of the viability of repurposing of the gas pipeline network to support each of the different technology options considered. This critique, both positive and negative, is reflected in the quotes pre - sented in the below subsections 3.1 to 3.4. In each case the interviewee number (#1 to #12) and affiliation of the person providing the quote is provided. 3.1. Relative risks and benefits Interviewees considered the risks, benefits and feasibility of the six presented options, in the context of wider residential heating reforms and the pursuit of Net Zero. These critical discussions, both positive and negative, were prompted by the criterion assessments presented on the flash cards and map to the following sub-themes (3.1.1 – 3.1.4): health and safety issues, the practicalities of repurposing the gas network, carbon reduction potential, and implications for workforce employ - ment. While there was consideration of all six options presented, the primary focus of the practitioners was on considering the relative ben - efits of hydrogen versus heat pumps. CAES was considered to be less applicable within the context of residential sector heating applications, and practitioners were less familiar with the technology, and so it tended not to be discussed as frequently. 3.1.1. Health and safety issues Safety was a primary focus for the practitioners when considering the technology options presented. Most practitioners identified hydrogen as posing the most substantial safety risks and drawbacks. There was concern about the safety risks posed by hydrogen both during its transportation (particularly if using the existing gas pipeline network) and during its use within the home environment. Concern not only related to the general potential for gas leakages (and related human Fig. 1. The hydrogen ‘Top Trump ’ information flashcard used to prompt discussion within the stakeholder interviews. Table 2 Description of the criteria used to rate each of the residential home heating options within the flash cards. Criterion Description Cost benefit to consumers The monetary benefits to consumers (e.g. prospective savings on energy bills) after installing or accessing the option. Higher scores equate to greater cost benefit. Safety The degree to which a product can cause health and/or safety risks to consumers when used in residential heating applications. Higher scores equate to greater safety. Market potential An estimate of the potential revenue that could be secured by retailing the option within existing industry, investor and consumer markets. Higher scores equate to higher market potential. Carbon reduction The reduction of carbon emissions that could be yielded were there to be widespread deployment of the option in the UK residential sector. Higher scores equate to greater carbon reduction potential. Investment payback time The length of time that it would take those investing in the option (including consumers) to recover the costs of their financial outlay. Higher scores equate to quicker return on investment. Business as usual The degree of disruption caused to householders and/or the wider community when installing and using the option. Higher scores equate to less disruptive and more ‘business as usual ’ continuation of residential heating practices. Commercially available (years) An estimate of when the option will become widely commercially available to installers and consumers. V. Seymour et al.

{"page_content": "health implications) and changes to the gas flow in the pipeline, but also the potential for the build-up of the flammable gas within enclosed household environments. While analogous to the safety risks posed by natural gas, being a lighter gas and one less familiar to consumers, hydrogen was considered to pose additional safety risks in this regard. For example, one participant noted: “I am concerned by the safety issues of hydrogen because of the inter - action with the user. You know, hydrogen is a fundamentally different chemical. It can leak out of a really tiny hole and really quite quickly. As long as you’ve got enough ventilation then that is not a problem because it disperses. … And the idea that the householder won’t go, that’s a bit draughty. I’m going to shove something in there and block it up. That worries me because that’s what people do if they don’t understand a new system. And if you tell them they absolutely can’t cause otherwise the house might blow up. Well that’s scary” (#12, Industry Professional). By contrast, the interviewees tended to view air-source, ground- source, and especially water-source heat pumps as being relatively safe options. This both extended to considerations of their use within the home environment and, in the case of water source heat-pumps, to the prospect of transporting water to homes using the legacy gas pipeline network. Interviewees tended to refer to heat pumps as being ‘tried and tested’ options, which have a long history of use for residential heating. That said, while acknowledging their general safety record, one inter - viewee did caution (based on anecdotal experience) against the fire risks associated with heat pumps. In doing so, they referred to the public underestimation of risk associated with electrical appliances (relative to gas appliances), which could lead to potential complacency among heat pump owners: “A heat pump is pretty safe. I would note that. We actually had a fire on the electrical installation on our heat pump. Thankfully the fire was outside the house. But people have a very different attitude towards gas safety than they do electrical safety. But the reality is you have a higher number of electrical instances in homes than you do gas” (#4, Energy Provider). While heat pump technologies were generally favoured in terms of their safety, some concerns were raised about the installation and use of thermochemically-assisted heat pumps. Practitioners voiced their inability to reflect on safety issues associated with repurposing the existing gas pipe network to support this technology, due to their un - familiarity with the concept. However, citing this option’s reliance on hazardous chemical substances (e.g., ammonia), there were questions about the potential risks to human health (if the system was not self- contained) within households supporting this technology, and whether it was safe for residents to directly handle the chemicals: “You know ammonia is not nice really. I mean, OK, you wouldn’t expect it to leak. It should be self-contained.” (#9, Senior Policy Adviser). 3.1.2. Practicalities of repurposing the gas network Most interviewees reflected on the practicalities of repurposing the gas pipeline network to support each of the different options. The nature of their reflections tended to relate to their general roles and re - sponsibilities within their sector. While hydrogen and compressed air (CAES) were generally felt by most to offer a more ‘business as usual’ means of repurposing the network – given that these options essentially exchange natural gas for another gas (i.e., hydrogen or air) – others welcomed the potential to use the network to support alternative resi - dential heating options, including the water-source heat pumps pro - posed by the XXXX project. The reasons cited for this primarily centred on the cost-effectiveness of repurposing the gas pipeline network for transporting water to homes as opposed to extracting and installing new infrastructure. It was also anticipated that repurposing would be less disruptive to different stakeholder groups (e.g., industry, householders), and would lessen competition for subterranean road space: “Yeah, why not? I mean, if it’s fit for purpose because it’s, you know, huge volume, it’s widely spaced and it’s you know more widely available. Again, it’s bringing the principle back to being close to the point of use. You know it would help tick that box. “You could carry on as you are. Digging up the roads. And pouring money into digging up roads and putting our big pipes of water in under the roads. … [Or] why don’t we use the gas companies’ big yellow pipes [that] are already there. Gas companies can then buy that off us and sell it on to the customer at the other end or we will pay the gas company and use the system charge” (#12, Industry Professional).

Gas companies can then buy that off us and sell it on to the customer at the other end or we will pay the gas company and use the system charge” (#12, Industry Professional). While there was some enthusiasm for the potential to repurpose the existing gas pipeline network, this was tempered by considerations about the necessary work that would need to take place ahead of any such repurposing, whether to support the transport and storage of another a gas or to provide other services (e.g., to carry water or chemicals). It was reasoned that repurposing the network would need to be done for a single dedicated purpose (e.g. for the transportation of hydrogen or for use in CAES), with repurposing for multiple purposes seen as creating a variety of health and safety concerns (e.g., those that might come associated with the mixing compressed air and hydrogen). It was also recognised that there would need to be (potentially costly) upgrades to parts of the existing gas pipeline network to support any repurposing, whether through the creation of additional pipeline infrastructure (e.g. to remove thermochemical waste from homes) or the need to exchange parts of the pipeline network to store and transport hydrogen gas more effectively. This led some interviewees to question the value of repurposing the network to support residential heating applications: “Even if we’re reusing the natural gas network, we can’t simply put hydrogen straight into the existing natural gas network. So, there’s considerable costs associated with upgrading that. I think it’s got quite an infrastructure cost. I think there’s better uses of hydrogen, certainly. As we begin to ramp up green hydrogen production, I think it’s better used for that in industry and potential in transport than large vehicles. So, I would prioritise using it there first and I think we need to do something else for building it” (#11, Academic). 3.1.3. Carbon reduction potential Interviewees discussed the relative carbon reduction benefits that could be yielded reasonably achieved from each of the six options. The benefits that could yielded by hydrogen, for instance, were considered with reference to the way in which the hydrogen would be produced. For some, it was felt that ‘blue’ hydrogen (derived from fossil fuels with carbon capture) or ‘grey’ hydrogen (derived from fossil fuels without carbon capture) would be the primary source in the short term, until such time as lower carbon options were more readily available (e.g. ‘green’ hydrogen produced through the electrolysis of water using renewable energy). This led to some scepticism over the potential car - bon reductions that would be achieved by switching to hydrogen the short term and thus whether ‘Net Zero’ targets would actually be attainable via this route alone. This, in turn, raised the question of whether there would also need to be the larger-scale deployment of other energy technologies (e.g., heat pumps) within the residential sector need to support the switch to hydrogen. Other interviewees queried whether or not it would be feasible to scale-up the production of hydrogen sufficiently to satisfy UK residential heating demand. As such, the prospect of using hydrogen to support other sectors (e.g., industrial sector) was seen as a more appropriate goal: “I mean, there seems to be a bit of a leaning towards green hydrogen, which is fine. The challenge with that is going to be the availability of it in sufficient quantities anytime soon” (Interviewee 11, Academic). In contrast to hydrogen, heat pumps (including water-source and V.

{"page_content": "thermochemical option) were perceived as having greater potential to reduce carbon footprints within residential heating. This positivity was, however, caveated by an awareness that the potential decarbonisation that could be afforded by heat-pumps would be tied to the decarbon - isation of the electricity used to run them and also, in the case of the thermochemical options, the carbon-footprint of the chemicals. It was also recognised that there could be geographical restrictions around the use of water-source heat pumps in certain areas: “It does [water-source heat pumps] have good carbon reduction. So, the grid continues to be carbonised and heat pumps continue to become increasingly green” (#8, Energy Provider). 3.1.4. Implications for workforce employment Interviewees were also keen to point out the employment opportu - nities presented by the decarbonisation of residential heating in the UK. For instance, most interviewees noted that the innovation in this sector presents opportunities for those working in the natural gas industry to be retained and retrained, as well as improving the prospect of attracting a more diverse workforce (e.g. providing more women and ethnic mi - norities with more prominent and leadership roles): “And I think that a more diverse workforce could also help the workforce better understand the people that are making decisions and the home and better trust in the workforce” (#3, Energy-focused consumer body representative). Some interviewees emphasised the associated need for a rapid roll- out of accredited training programmes (e.g., heat pump installation training) in order to achieve the target of transitioning quickly towards a Net Zero residential heating sector, regardless of the energy options eventually used. One interviewee noted that without the provision of such training there could be a risk of redundancies and/or job displacement (e.g., established engineers being usurped by younger engineers trained in modern heating systems): “But they’re hanging their own workers out to dry, aren’t they? Because at some point the tide will turn and these people will find themselves with the skills mismatch. “And I wonder, are the same people that are going to be installing and servicing heat pumps as are doing the gas boilers? I don’t think it’s necessarily the same people unless there’s a clear intervention. I think those coming out of college or whatever are going to do the more modern heating systems and these more established gas engineers will be obsolete” (#7, Policy Advisor). 3.2. Public choice and control Interviewees engaged in an interesting discussion around the concept of choice and autonomy for householders when selecting how they wish their home to be heated. While empowering people to choose was considered to be important, it was reasoned that the extent of the choices available to householders might need to be restricted. For example, options reliant on the repurposing of the gas pipeline network would likely necessitate a connection to the network in the first place. The majority of interviewees thus described the future residential heating sector as a “patchwork of feasible low carbon energy options”, the make-up of which would vary depending on the specifics of the deployment circumstances: “I think there’s a phrase that I think that the gas networks and people like to use is consumer choice. Infinite choice is not helpful when we don’t have the tools to make the right decisions. I think we need to empower decision making, which actually doesn’t mean making every choice available. It’s like either [the] area is going to have predominantly gas networks, gas, or hydrogen. We can’t have both in an area” (#9, Policy Advisor). Interviewees also highlighted that in some cases, consumer ‘choice’ might not be determined on an individual basis, but at a communal scale. This being due to the viability and cost-effectiveness of certain options being contingent upon the synchronised rollout at a street, neighbourhood or community scale (e.g., CAES, heat networks, hydrogen). This is likely be of particular relevance when considering the XXXX project options, given that these would involve a large-scale repurposing to the legacy gas pipeline in order to be practicable. It was suggested that the (essentially) “like for like” operation of hydrogen boilers and natural gas boilers, people’s general familiarity with gas central heating and their knowledge of how to respond in the event of a boiler breakdown or emergency, as well as the continued use of the existing gas network, would likely work in favour of consumer decision regarding hydrogen. Akin to the findings of other research, the upfront cost and opera - tional affordability, installation disruptions (e.g., developing new or repurposing existing pipe networks), and investment payback time were anticipated to be key drivers of householders’ preferences for different technology options. “Costs are probably the biggest one, or rather, affordability [of installing heat pump options].

This was particularly seen as an issue among those in fuel poverty and/or those living in rented accommodation, where there might be less opportunity or con - trol over whether to switch their means of household heating, and where such households might be further (inadvertently) penalised by efforts to reduce the carbon-footprint of the sector (e.g., through higher taxes on the use of natural gas): “[There’s] environmental levies. So, if we shifted towards putting the [tax] levies on gas instead of on electricity, then that might have a big impact on the investment in electric focused options. There [would be] risks around the fuel poverty impacts of this” (#3, Energy-focused consumer body representative). 3.3. The need for continuous public engagement Implementing best practices to enhance public awareness and engagement were commonly identified as key things needed to support the energy transition, both in the UK and abroad. The interviewees emphasised the need to foster trust between industry, the government and publics during the transition period, as well as the need to deepen (individualised) public understanding of the practical issues associated with installing the different types of residential sector heating options. This latter point included raising public awareness of each option’s feasibility for different property types, any disruption that could be faced (e.g., timescales for installation, changes to the physical home environment), potential health and safety considerations, and any qualitative change to the heating quality (and associated sensory expe - rience) that would be implied: “It’s about having conversations with every single household. To explain to them what their options are, and understand their own cause. Some homes might be perfect for a heat pump. Some homes might [not]” (#5, Energy provider). Perhaps mirroring their own perceived lack of knowledge about the XXXX Project options discussed at interview, the practitioners tended to believe that public-facing information on the range of heating-sector decarbonisation options was currently deficient. Even among the more well-publicised options like hydrogen and air-source heat pumps (and V. Seymour et al.

{"page_content": "related things like insulation schemes), there was concern about misinformation entering the public domain (e.g., via social media) and even the deliberate spread of disinformation by fossil fuel lobbyists. For instance, some interviewees suggested that fossil fuel lobbyists had propagated disinformation relating to a prospective switch from natural gas to hydrogen, leading some people to believe that existing boiler systems would not need to be changed. The assertion here was that fossil fuel companies could continue to profit from the continued use of the existing gas pipeline network to transport hydrogen, and so had a vested interest in encouraging a favourable public response to this option. The low uptake of heat pumps amongst members of the public was attributed by some interviewees to a general lack of information about the technology. For example, it was suggested that the true financial costs associated with installation of air and ground-source heat pumps, and the existence and/or size of the incentivisation schemes available to facilitate their installation, had not been well communicated to the public: “We’ve seen some publications around boilers that are saying they’re hydrogen ready and it’s green that’s just not true. I don’t expect people to know these things. I’m not saying that they should know. There’s a really big grey area. And there’s certainly a lot of misinformation around heat pumps out there and there’s a lot of misinformation arounddifferent types of insulation” (#1, Energy-focused consumer body representative). ‘Peer-to-peer communications’ were also regarded both as an enabler and hindrance on people’s decisions to adopt new heating technologies, particularly air and ground-source heat pumps. While some saw such peer-to-peer communication to be a positive thing, offering people a vicarious ‘try before you buy’ exposure to the technologies, it was also considered problematic where testimony from peers was unfavourable. “Knowing people, because that’s how you try it. It’s like all my friends have got one of those. They say it’s fantastic and I’ve been to their house and it feels quite nice” (Participant 10, Academic). Commonly cited complaints about heat-pumps were stated to include the noise generated by them, the space required for them, and the qualitative difference in heat quality supplied by them: “Our imagination of how to make these things something that people are not worried or will complain about. For instance, the sight of them and the noise of them and the whatever you know” (#8, Energy Provider). Although the focus of the practitioners’ discussions on this point centred around the more familiar and recognised types of heat pump (i. e., air and ground-source), there was a sense that the sentiments would likely be extended to those types of heat pump being proposed by the XXXX project (i.e., thermochemical and water-source). 3.4. Envisioning future transition scenarios for residential sector heating When envisioning the residential sector heating transition, it was common for interviewees to highlight other options that had not been considered as part of the structured conversation. For example, infrared heating panels were identified as a potential solution for hard-to-retrofit and listed properties. When specifically considering options that could see the repurposing of the gas pipeline network, many participants were quick to question why heat networks or hybrid heat pumps were not considered. Hybrid heat pumps being a standard heat pump backed up by another source (e.g., natural gas or hydrogen): “There are small apartments and town houses within the district heating technology option, there are both some brilliant opportunities, but also some limitations” (#12, Industry Professional). Some interviewees, particularly those from energy-focused con - sumer bodies, took the opportunity to question whether or not the repurposing of the gas pipeline network to support hydrogen was even necessary; given the ongoing advances in electric-based options (e.g., renewable energy technologies) available via some of the larger elec - tricity suppliers: “You like continuing to use gas and burning gas in your home. It feels unnecessary when you could use electricity” (#3, Energy-focused consumer body). Interviewees were keen to reflect on the government’s ambitious residential sector decarbonisation targets. While the technologies dis - cussed within the interview (including the XXXX project options) were seen as helping the advancement towards these targets, the sense was that there were some key factors that were delaying progress. These factors included: (a) the belief that the funding and incentive mecha - nisms designed to encourage consumers to install heat pump technolo - gies were inadequate and/or ill-informed; (b) a perceived lack of quality among some industry stakeholders (e.g., ‘cowboy builders’) and the need for appropriate training and accreditation; and (c) the need to move beyond the ‘trial phase’ of some technology options, in order to see the wider roll-out of them. The urgent need for a change to the status quo was reflected in deliberations about the remaining timescales over which to achieve ‘Net Zero’:", "metadata": {"producer": "Acrobat Distiller 8.1.0 (Windows)", "creator": "Elsevier", "creationdate": "2025-04-26T11:40:38+00:00", "crossmarkdomains[1]": "elsevier.com", "crossmarkmajorversiondate": "2010-04-23", "creationdate--text": "26th April 2025", "elsevierwebpdfspecifications": "7.0.1", "robots": "noindex", "moddate": "2025-04-26T12:34:12+00:00", "author": "V.

{"page_content": "could use electricity” (#3, Energy-focused consumer body). Interviewees were keen to reflect on the government’s ambitious residential sector decarbonisation targets. While the technologies dis - cussed within the interview (including the XXXX project options) were seen as helping the advancement towards these targets, the sense was that there were some key factors that were delaying progress. These factors included: (a) the belief that the funding and incentive mecha - nisms designed to encourage consumers to install heat pump technolo - gies were inadequate and/or ill-informed; (b) a perceived lack of quality among some industry stakeholders (e.g., ‘cowboy builders’) and the need for appropriate training and accreditation; and (c) the need to move beyond the ‘trial phase’ of some technology options, in order to see the wider roll-out of them. The urgent need for a change to the status quo was reflected in deliberations about the remaining timescales over which to achieve ‘Net Zero’: “The longer we leave it, the harder it is to build the supply chains, the less we’ll have the skills. So, whilst I remain optimistic that if we did the right things now we could do it. We haven’t got long left” (#7, policy advisor). Part way through our series of interviews, in September 2023, the UK Prime Minister (Rishi Sunak) announced his government’s revised plans to achieve Net Zero by 2050. This included the announcement of an increase to the boiler upgrade scheme (helping people to move from gas boilers to heat pumps) but simultaneously extending the timescales for the phase out of gas boilers (pushing it back from 2026 to 2035). This shift in policy altered how some interviewees envisioned future energy transitions. For some, this shift in policy further strengthened their be - liefs in the need for a stronger political direction (e.g., to create investor confidence) and better public guidance around the decarbonisation of residential sector heating (e.g., a roadmap). The delay also raised questions as to whether residential sector heating targets would actually ever be achieved: “Because there’s just not enough time, and there’s only perhaps two allocation rounds to go that would meet delivery by the 2030 target deadline. … You know the ripple effects of it all are that it impacts [public] investor confidence. You know we keep saying we’re leading the way on net zero and it’s like. Are we? I mean, there are lots of good things that have happened. You know, through the last decade we’ve built a lot of wind, coal is nearly gone off the system. But it needs to be speeding up a bit more” (#12, Industry Professional). In response to this announcement, other participants alluded to the evident political tension between the need to promote economic growth and the need to rapidly decarbonise. While some were frustrated over the UK government’s apparent prioritisation of economic growth – ostensibly undervaluing the potential climatic risks that could be implied by delaying the phasing out of gas boilers – others believed that the delay could be beneficial. It was seen as providing space and time for businesses to make better, more strategic investment decisions relating to their products; allowing for the development of improved technolo - gies and supply chains and for the repurposing of existing energy infrastructure (e.g., the gas pipeline network) to support their intro - duction. In turn, this would help to avoid snap decisions that might favour the investment in and roll-out of sub-optimal solutions: “We operate a low carbon energy business and we always have done. Therefore we embrace government policy to promote low carbon energy. We need time and we need money and we need stable technologies and we need mature supply chains.

{"page_content": "and they are not decisions we are ever going to make. The fact that the government is taking some of the pressure off in terms of timelines may help us and help our business and others like us because we see that there will be extensive mistakes made ” ( #8, Energy Provider ). Most interviewees were also keen to outline alternative strategies for residential sector heating decarbonisation to those currently being pursued by the UK government. In addition to calls for more strategic policies and stronger leadership, the recommendations included the need for more localised planning (underpinned by accurate modelling and forecasting) around the delivery of decarbonisation options, as well as a plan for the ‘final few ’, to ensure a just transition for all and to safeguard against certain people being left behind. Others also expressed the need for future proofing households against different forms of extreme climate challenge (e.g., by installing units offering heating and cooling functionality for those who might have to contend with hotter summer periods): “ I think it ’ s like France or Italy where the majority use the other type of heat pump. One that does cooling as well. And all of the [heat pumps] talked about in the UK don ’ t … think about future proofing. ” ( #10, Academic ). 4. General discussion The aim of this study was to consider the perceptions of key stake - holders (‘practitioners ’ ) in the UK residential heat decarbonisation sector about: (a) policies pertaining to this sector; (b) the factors likely to shape public acceptance of hydrogen and heat-pump technologies; and (c) the prospect of repurposing the gas pipeline network to support heat decarbonisation. Interview discussions centred around four primary themes: (1) Relative risks and benefits; (2) Public choice and control over residential heating options; (3) Engaging with the public throughout the energy transition; and (4) Envisioning future energy transition scenarios for residential home heating. These findings can be used to support decision-making around practicable ways to decarbon - ise the sector in accordance with ‘Net Zero ’ aspirations ( Lowes & Woodman, 2020 ). 4.1. Key findings Our findings build on those from prior research into societal per - ceptions of individual low-carbon residential sector heating options ( Fern ´andez-Dacosta et al., 2019; Acar et al., 2019; Gaur et al. 2022; Bartela et al., 2022 ), by providing a comparative assessment of several established and emerging technologies within this sector. 4.1.1. Risks and benefits Due to their relative familiarity and proximity to residential heating applications, interviewees mostly discussed the relative benefits of heat pumps and hydrogen. By comparison, CAES was only occasionally referenced. While there was some consideration of the implications for non-public social actors (e.g., investors, planners, etc.), the primary lens used when considering the options was how they would interface with householders and the wider public. This focus makes sense given the sector under consideration, but perhaps also reflects the recognised power that the actions of publics can have over the success of technol - ogies ( Boudet, 2019; Devine-Wright et al., 2017 ) and the duty of care that ‘elites ’ have when making decisions that could impact upon the health, safety and wellbeing of citizens. Given this, it was unsurprising that many of the initial exchanges focused on the relative risks to human health of each of the options under consideration. In principle, it was considered that, while not devoid of risk, heat pumps were a safer alternative to hydrogen. Consistent with other findings ( Scovell, 2022 ), the prospect of unde - tectable leaks and explosions principally underpinned this preference. The exception to this ‘rule ’ were thermochemical heat pumps, which were considered separately from air, ground and water-source options due to the potential need for householders to handle chemicals. In - terviewees were also less familiar with this option. Discussions branched into a consideration of public perceptions of risk and how this might drive adoption decisions and use practices for both these technologies. In the case of hydrogen, it was suggested that a familiarity with gas-based residential heating could be appealing. The perceived continuity and ‘simplicity ’ of substituting natural gas with hydrogen (e.g., for heating practices, heating quality, etc.) was also anticipated to dull some of the health and safety concerns associated with this option, thus driving consumer acceptance. Although, the ‘simplicity ’ of this switch was seen to be contentious and something that might be a product of mis-information sharing. In the case of heat pumps, there were general concerns that publics might view them as ‘just another electrical device ’ which could promote complacency around the risks associated with their use. This raises the crucial importance of developing and disseminating", "metadata": {"producer": "Acrobat Distiller 8.1.0 (Windows)", "creator": "Elsevier", "creationdate": "2025-04-26T11:40:38+00:00", "crossmarkdomains[1]": "elsevier.com", "crossmarkmajorversiondate": "2010-04-23", "creationdate--text": "26th April 2025", "elsevierwebpdfspecifications": "7.0.1", "robots": "noindex", "moddate": "2025-04-26T12:34:12+00:00", "author": "V.

In the case of heat pumps, there were general concerns that publics might view them as ‘just another electrical device ’ which could promote complacency around the risks associated with their use. This raises the crucial importance of developing and disseminating appropriate risk commu - nication for householders, to counter subjective under-estimation of risk and promote the safe use of these technologies ( Renn & Benighaus, 2013 ). In addition to their comparative safety, heat pumps were also considered to be a scalable, ‘plug and play ’ means of decarbonising the residential heating sector (provided the national electricity grid could be decarbonised). By contrast, the role that hydrogen could play in this regard was questioned both on the grounds of source and supply. Spe - cifically, unless there is a rapid scale-up in the production and supply of low-carbon hydrogen, then residential sector heat decarbonisation based on hydrogen was deemed impractical. In reality, interviewees tended to believe in a portfolio solution for the decarbonisation, with the mix of technologies being determined by the physical (e.g., existing infrastructure) and social (e.g., demand profile, demographic) context of different regions of the UK. As such, the ‘hydrogen versus heat pump ’ distinction was often considered a false- comparison. Not only because the practicability of each option can vary by context, but also because a broad, abstracted distinction glosses over the relative strengths and weaknesses of different sub- classifications of the technology (e.g., air-vs. ground-source heat pumps), and the fact that hydrogen and heat-pumps can be hybridised. This reflection likely stems from our research approach, where a limited set of options were presented, stimulating a desire to consider different pathways to decarbonisation among our interviewees. 4.1.2. The need for a just transition Consistent with prior research (Thomas et al.2024), interviewees referenced the need to ensure that the decarbonisation of residential heating was fair and ‘just ’. Considerations here ranged from: (a) ensuring that householders were provided with appropriate agency over heating upgrades (e.g., ensuring appliances and running costs were affordable and/or suitably subsidised); (b) limiting disruption during installation or construction; (c) promoting consumer protections and workforce sustainability (e.g. through training, accreditation and regu - lation of installers); and (d) providing assurances that certain groups (e. g., renters) would not get ‘left behind ’ (or actively penalised) if they were not in a position to upgrade. The desirability of affording householders with choice and control was juxtaposed with some of the difficulties in doing so. These included variability in the practicability of (and thus access to) technology op - tions in some contexts (e.g., the absence of a suitable water source to support a water-source heat pump), as well as the need to ensure wider community support for the introduction of technology options in other contexts (e.g., converting from natural gas to hydrogen). Both of these examples evidence an impingement on a householder ’ s ‘freedom to choose ’, and could pose problems for acceptance. Relatedly, in - terviewees referenced the need to increase the volume and specificity of public outreach programmes around innovations in residential heating; V. Seymour et al. Technology in Society 81 (2025) 102849 9", "metadata": {"producer": "Acrobat Distiller 8.1.0 (Windows)", "creator": "Elsevier", "creationdate": "2025-04-26T11:40:38+00:00", "crossmarkdomains[1]": "elsevier.com", "crossmarkmajorversiondate": "2010-04-23", "creationdate--text": "26th April 2025", "elsevierwebpdfspecifications": "7.0.1", "robots": "noindex", "moddate": "2025-04-26T12:34:12+00:00", "author": "V.

{"page_content": "helping to combat the spread of misinformation, while making house - holders aware of the practicability and implications of different options for their homes (e.g., for heating quality and practices). Such a sugges - tion is consistent with recommendations from cognate studies that advocate for the need for further public outreach and involvement in discussions about energy transitions (e.g., Gordon et al., 2022; Ren & Ogura, 2021; Suboticki et al., 2023 ). We argue there could be benefits to developing outreach pro - grammes explicitly tailored around the promotion of contextual (e.g., street, neighbourhood) ‘equity’ rather than equality. This would give people a more realistic sense of the options available to them in their context and could be paired with efforts to illustrate how heating up - grades could assist regional (and by proxy national) efforts to decar - bonise. A focus on community-centric, equity-based communication plays both to the calls from this study for more localised decision- making, but also to the wider literature attesting to the value of tar - geted and tailored messaging ( Bostrom et al., 2013 ). This could be very important in situations where there is a need for communal ‘buy in’ to schemes (e.g., conversion to hydrogen), particularly given the reported influence that peer-to-peer communication might have upon attitudes and actions towards residential heat decarbonisation. 4.1.3. Opinions on gas pipeline repurposing A key aspect of this study was on gathering practitioner perspectives on the prospect of repurposing the national gas pipeline network to support an array of low-carbon residential heating options (i.e., the focus of the XXXX project). In principle, the concept of repurposing was well-received due to the fact that such steps would make good use of an otherwise redundant legacy asset, and given that repurposing could link more citizens to more technology options (e.g., water-source heat pumps). However, while the concept had broad appeal, the practical and economic feasibility of the idea was questioned. Interviewees variously referenced issues like the engineering complexity, construction disrup - tion, and fuzzy or uncertain financial costs. It was suggested that the electrification of heating (incl. standard air, ground and water source heat-pumps) might negate the need to repurpose the gas pipeline network. And, although born from a lack of familiarity with the concept, there was also speculation over the potential for repurposing to intro - duce additional health and safety risks, particularly where might different options might interface (e.g., hydrogen and CAES). Given that most of the interviewees agreed that a ‘patchwork of options’ would be needed for the just and practicable decarbonisation of the sector, there is a need for further development, costing and knowl - edge exchange with practitioners about the concept of repurposing. Not only will this provide clarity over the type and scale of repurposing required to support different technology options – particularly those considered to be more ‘niche’ (e.g., thermochemical extraction) – but also so that the technical, economic and social viability of repurposing can be weighed-up against the alternative solutions (e.g., the capping and/or removal and backfilling of the pipeline network). The recent announcements by the UK government regarding the timescales for phasing out traditional gas boilers have extended a window of oppor - tunity to consider and cost the relative benefits of repurposing, and to provide strong and evidenced-based policy and market recommenda - tions before decisions are taken. 4.2. Methodological strengths and limitations The use of comparative flash cards ( Jones et al., 2014; Kalehsar, 2021) within this study proved to be a useful means of eliciting con - versation with the interviewees. Some interviewees even recommended that these flash cards to publicly accessible, to improve awareness of the options and to allow householders to make more informed choices about the options available to them ( Becker et al., 2023 ). However, the flash cards only presented brief details of the six options being considered by the GasNetNew project, with some practitioners questioning the omission of other options from the discussion (e.g., district heating networks), options which might serve as future considerations, and also referencing their lack of (basic or applied) familiarity with some of the options presented. Thus, while the flash card discussions were still fruitful, the potential value in presenting extended details about a greater number of technology options in future work cannot be dis - missed.

While such conceptual discussion holds value, there can be discrepancies with how technolo - gies are received and responded to when they are physically deployed ( Schively, 2007; van der Horst, 2007 ). Future research will therefore be needed to chart how the technologies discussed within our interviews perform ‘in practice’, particularly those that are more niche or innova - tive (e.g., thermochemically-assisted heat pumps). Indeed, practitioners requested further research into the safety and performance of each alternative residential heating options, most notably in the case of hydrogen and thermochemical heat pumps. The fairness of energy transitions for those employed within the sector, was interesting topic of discussion within the study. References made to the risks of not upskilling existing gas engineers resonate with other studies exploring shifting employability and skills development in the energy sector (e.g., van der Ree, 2019; Saussay et al., 2022; Bray et al., 2024 ). However, the opportunities presented by this evolution (e. g., in terms of diversifying the workforce and furthering the sector’s corporate social responsibility) also have credibility ( Bray et al., 2024 ). 4.3. Future research Scaling-up and broadening recruitment in future studies would be a suitable way to investigate if the findings of this study (e.g., in terms of content and reasoning) are transferable beyond the immediate circum - stances. For instance, while this study focuses exclusively on residential sector decarbonisation, investigating the determinants of the social acceptance of the energy options among different sectors will be important. Further, employability-themed discussions need further unpacking, as the implications for the composition and sustainability of workforces in this rapidly changing sector, remain relatively under- studied. 4.4. Policy implications There was a general sense among the interviewees that successful decarbonisation would be determined by better programmes of funding and incentivisation, set alongside more comprehensive training and accreditation of installers. While not disputing this assertion, there is clearly a need to understand the reasons for the continuing under- performance of existing decarbonisation schemes if a policy of further investment is to be successful. To the extent that a lack of trained in - stallers is contributing to the problem, the introduction of comprehen - sive training and accreditation programmes would be advisable, while also helping to address concerns around the sustainability in the employment of the existing workforce. It is also important to look more closely at the public outreach and messaging around schemes (particu - larly those advocating less familiar technology options) to not only promote initial ‘buy in’ to schemes, but to also promote the retention of consumers to the point of installation. A need for stronger leadership and clearer policies around sector decarbonisation were advocated by our interviewees. Such conditions should not only serve to improve market confidence (i.e., market acceptance), but would also provide a more consistent signal to publics of the need for change. The issues of inconsistent messaging/signalling were brought into focus by the then government’s announcement V. Seymour et al.

While some practitioners (e.g., energy providers) viewed this positively (buying time to think before further committing the UK to a policy di - rection), others suggested it might undermine efforts to communicate with publics about the climate emergency. That said, to the extent that affordability (vs. environmental) considerations, principally drive con - sumer decision-making in this sector ( Parrish et al., 2022 ), perhaps these concerns over the impact of an unfavourable public reaction were overstated. Efforts to improve and promote the affordability of alternative resi - dential heating options are likely to be crucial in improving their uptake. To the extent that efforts to repurpose the gas pipeline can be leveraged to support the wider introduction of heat-pumps and hydrogen, this could be a useful means of improving their cost-competitiveness. This should not only resonate with the ‘affordability bias ’ driving household decisions around technology uptake (providing a route to improved penetration),but could also improve the general accessibility to different technology options for consumers (providing a route to a more just transition), while also crucially helping to decarbonise the sector ( Gorden et al., 2024 ). 5. Conclusion Taken together, this study advances our understanding of practi - tioner perspectives on the social acceptability of several options for decarbonising residential heating in the UK (i.e., heat pumps, hydrogen and CAES), including some that can be supported by repurposing the existing gas pipeline network. The findings confirm that the factors and actors feeding into the relative ‘acceptability ’ of each option are mani - fold, and that the ‘acceptance ’ of each option is tied to factors, such as: (a) the consistency of policy signals from government; (b) the relative affordability of the technology (incl. the availability and success of financing schemes); and (c) both the physical (e.g., infrastructure) and social (e.g., peer-to-peer communication) aspects of the local develop - ment context. The findings of this study can be used to help support evidence-led decision-making about the potential routes to sector decarbonisation and the role that innovative repurposing could play in making this transition more affordable and fair.

Conducted through a survey sent to all Danish re - searchers from January to February 2024, the study received 2534 responses and evaluated 32 GenAI use cases across five research phases: idea generation, research design, data collection, data analysis, and writing/ reporting. Respondents reported on their own and colleagues ’ GenAI usage. They also assessed whether the practices in the use cases were considered good research practice. Through an explorative factor analysis, we identified three clusters of perception: \"GenAI as a work horse\", \"GenAI as a language assistant only\", and \"GenAI as a research accelerator\". The findings further show varied opinions on GenAI ’ s research integrity implications. Language editing and data analysis were generally viewed positively, whereas experiment design and peer re - view tasks faced more criticism. Controversial areas included image creation/modification and synthetic data, with comments highlighting the need for critical and reflexive use of GenAI. Usage differed by main research area, with technical and quantitative sciences reporting slightly higher usage and more positive assessments. Junior researchers used GenAI more than senior colleagues, while no significant gender differences were observed. The study underscores the need for adaptable, discipline-specific guidelines for GenAI use in research, developed collaboratively with experts to align with diverse research practices and minimize ethical and prac - tical misalignment. 1. Introduction Research employing Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) is rapidly expanding across fields and is anticipated to accelerate and transform scientific knowledge [ 1 ]. As in many other parts of society, the integration of GenAI into academic research is characterised by a wide range of attitudes, perceptions, and yet to be developed practices. Owing to the inherent uncertainties that come along with new tech - nologies, fierce debates have emerged over the potential benefits, risks and challenges of using GenAI for research purposes (e.g. Ref. [ 2, 3 ]). As the technology continues to reshape academic landscapes, understand - ing the adoption and impacts of GenAI in research practices becomes increasingly important. The currently evolving discourse surrounding GenAI within academia reflects a spectrum of engagement ranging from enthusiastic adoption [ 4, 5 ] to cautious valuation [ 6, 7 ] and scepticism [ 8 – 10 ]. Following an avalanche of opinion pieces and conceptual con - tributions, empirical studies offering valuable insights into GenAI ’ s adoption, perceptions, and anticipated impacts across different schol - arly activities are currently emerging. Studies acknowledge GenAI ’ s potential for efficiency gains and enhanced research processes, on one hand, while also revealing researchers ’ concerns about transparency, misinformation, biases, and generally unknown implications on the other [ 11 ]. While existing research has provided a foundation for understanding the complexities of GenAI adoption, limited empirical work has sys - tematically explored its diverse use and perceptions across academic contexts and research fields. This includes variations between disci - plines or ways of conducting research, as well as potential disparities * Corresponding author.

{"page_content": "across career stages, gender and other demographics. Furthermore, question remain about not only whether, but how academics might use GenAI in research and how they assess its research integrity implications across various use cases. Indeed, research practices as diverse as plan - ning experiments, writing project proposals, generating and collecting data, analysing it, reporting it or transforming it into lay-accessible content can all potentially be assisted or conducted by GenAI tools. However, whether researchers actually do this and how they assess research integrity aspects of using GenAI for these various cases, remains largely unknown. While several actors are preparing policy interventions to steer the usage of GenAI in research (e.g., publishers, funders or research in - stitutions aiming to govern particular research practices, e.g. Committee on Publication Ethics [ 12 ]), systematic understandings of researchers’ own practices become increasingly important. Indeed, such policy ini - tiatives tend to remain paper tigers if not properly aligned with practices of those they tend to govern [ 13 ]. This paper aims to deepen our un - derstanding of GenAI’s role in academia based on the results of a nationwide survey of researchers across Danish universities. By exploring how researchers from diverse backgrounds, fields and schol - arly traditions use and assess the application of GenAI for a wide range of research tasks, this paper seeks to contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of GenAI’s evolving role within academia. Ultimately, this is intended to inform the preparation of tailored guidelines and models of accountability. 1.1. Overview of other relevant studies In examining the current landscape of GenAI within academia, several studies have offered insights into its adoption, perceptions, and anticipated impacts across various scholarly activities. While most studies have focused on the use of GenAI in educational and teaching contexts, several have also examined research contexts. Notably, a sur - vey at a large U.S. research university revealed mixed attitudes among faculty and students towards GenAI, with a general openness to training despite low current usage and comfort levels, particularly in research contexts [ 14 ]. Contrastingly, a survey among higher education faculty reported a modest but growing integration of GenAI in research activ - ities, marking a 13-percentage point increase between spring and fall 2023 (9 % vs. 22 %) [ 15 ]. A survey among users of ResearchGate and Academia.edu found that reasons for researchers to use GenAI in their work are mainly related to timesaving, self-efficacy, self-esteem and reduction of stress. Conversely, concerns over academic integrity and negative peer evaluations of GenAI usage, limit researchers’ inclination to use GenAI tools for their work [ 16 ]. Additionally, several surveys were conducted in the context of the Nature portfolio of journals. A survey among authors of Nature articles and readers of Nature Briefing [ 11 ] found that while a large minority of researchers engaged with AI frequently, many expressed concerns about misinformation and biases, yet recognized benefits such as efficiency gains and improved accessibility for non-native English speakers. Another survey conducted by Nature among 3838 postdocs indicated similar level of engagement with GenAI, particularly chatbots, with 31 % of respondents reporting using chatbots. Interestingly, a majority (67 %) felt AI had not significantly altered their day-to-day work or career plans [ 17 ]. Similarly, a survey among readers of the Nature journal suggested a diversely engaging but cautious approach towards GenAI in academia [ 18 ]. Out of the 40 % that used GenAI at least occasionally, most report using it for coding tasks or to help write manuscripts, pre - pare presentations or conduct literature reviews. Furthering this discourse, findings from a UK-based survey high - lighted that over half of the academics utilized GenAI for efficiency, expecting its role to expand significantly [ 19 ]. This sentiment mirrors the European Research Council’s [ 20 ] survey results, which anticipated AI (not necessarily generative AI) fostering faster academic processes and enhancing human-AI collaborations, albeit with concerns about potential ethical and transparency issues. Apart from this host of survey studies on researchers’ use and per - ceptions of GenAI, two other empirical studies are worth mentioning here. A systematic review of the literature on guidelines and standards on how to use GenAI and Large Language Models (LLMs) in academic medicine [ 21 ] came to five recommendations for which they feel there is sufficient consensus among the research community, including state - ments like Chatbots not being allowed as an author in scientific manu - scripts; humans must be held accountable for use of ChatGPT/LLM and contents created by ChatGPT/LLM should be meticulously verified by humans.

The study highlights the necessity for robust guidelines to govern GenAI’s academic use, advocating for accountability in AI-generated content. This need for clarity and oversight is crucial as evidenced by Gray’s [ 22 ] quantitative analysis, which discovered a noticeable uptick in LLM-assisted publications within engineering and natural sciences – a trend that highlights the differential adoption rates across disciplines. Gray estimates that up to 85,000 LLM-assisted articles were published in 2023, indicating significant adoption of GenAI in academic publishing, for which other papers have provided (more anecdotal) evidence too. We note that the literature of studies examining GenAI use in the research process is likewise quickly developing and any overview will inevitably only provide a snapshot of the current state of affairs. Apart from empirical work on the adoption, perceptions and impli - cations of GenAI in research contexts, the ethical implications of this new technology have been hotly debated. Multiple ethical principles in question have been highlighted and based on a literature review, Ning et al. [ 23 ] identified nine key principles to be used to build an ethical framework for GenAI use in health care: accountability, autonomy, eq - uity, integrity, non-maleficence, privacy, security, transparency, and trust. These nine ethical dimensions are all related to broader ethical principles such as honesty (related to integrity) and fairness (related to equity). Ning et al. [ 23 ] use them to form a check list called “Trans - parent Reporting of Ethics for Generative AI (TREGAI)” that can be used to strengthen ethical considerations on the use of GenAI within health care and beyond. While these principles relate to the use of GenAI in multiple contexts, its use for research purposes raises additional ques - tions, for example related to authorship issues [ 24 ], copyright and in - tellectual property [ 25 ], and reproducibility and open science [ 24 ]. While many have called for swift actions in terms of improved ethical guidance and regulations (e.g. Ref. [ 26 ]), others acknowledge the fast-moving nature of this technology and the implication that any regulation is doomed to become outdated or obsolete soon after its development. Based on a Delphi process involving a panel of scholars from the social sciences, law, ethics, and scientific publishing, re - searchers co-created a set of core principles informing the responsible use of GenAI in research. This approach aims to allow flexible use under conditions of diverse technological developments and stipulates re - searchers to adhere to (principles of) regulation, data security, quality control, originality, bias mitigation, accountability, transparency and wider impact [ 27 ]. The latter notably also included social and climate justice. 1.2. Research objective and questions The empirical studies mentioned above collectively indicate an evolving uptake of GenAI technologies in the academic community. The insights reflect a spectrum of engagement, from enthusiastic adoption to fierce scepticism, which is still in flux. This evolution is evident in the significantly different results observed in subsequent waves of similar surveys. However, up to this point, studies have suggested some varia - tions but have failed to systematically examine the diversity of GenAI use and perceptions across academic contexts. This includes variations between disciplines or ways of doing research, as well as potential variations across career stages and other demographics. In addition, J.P. Andersen et al.

{"page_content": "relatively little is known about how academics use GenAI in their work and how they assess the research integrity of different GenAI practices, if they think of them as good or bad research practices. In this study, we aim to address these knowledge gaps by conducting a nation-wide survey of researchers at Danish universities. We examine how researchers from various backgrounds and scholarly traditions use and assess the use of GenAI for a wide range of research tasks. In the remainder of this article, we will report the results of this survey and reflect on the implications for regulating GenAI use for research pur - poses. Our article will be guided by two research questions. 1. For what purposes and to what extent is GenAI applied for research at Danish universities by researchers across different disciplines/ research fields, career stages and demographics? 2. What are the overall research integrity assessments of researchers towards the integration of GenAI in academic research? How do attitudes towards GenAI vary across different scientific fields, career stages, and demographics (e.g., gender, seniority)? 2. Methods A description of the survey, the sampling process and analysis plan were described prior to launching the survey and uploaded to OSF [ 37 ]. 2.1. Study participants The survey was fielded as a census of all researchers at Danish uni - versities. Previous studies have indicated that research practices and ways of producing knowledge, as well as researchers’ assessment of good and bad research practices, strongly differ between researchers from different research backgrounds, demographics and institutional contexts [ 28 ]. Therefore, we aimed to reach researchers from all main areas of research. As the accessibility and legal framework impacting the use of novel technologies and generative AI in particular, differs across national contexts [ 29 ], we decided to field our survey in a single country, in order to minimize variation in this respect. Together, these considerations resulted in our choice of including all researchers including PhD students at Danish universities as our participants. Par - ticipants were sampled by collecting contact details from the institu - tional personal webpages of the researchers. A script was written to automatically collect the email addresses of all research staff of Danish universities. This resulted in 50,652 people with contact details and job titles. As we were only interested in staff members with research tasks, we selected all job titles that occurred at least 50 times (118 job titles) and suggested an academic position that might involve research tasks (leaving 88 different job titles). This resulted in 30,590 people. Removing duplicates (e.g. researchers working at multiple departments, hence having multiple email addresses) and inactive email addresses, the survey was sent out to 29,498 researchers including PhD students at Danish universities on Jan 22nd, 2024. Two reminders were sent to researchers who had not fully completed the survey and had not opted out of receiving further communication about it. These waves of in - vitations were sent to 27,978 and 26,670 researchers respectively. Before starting the survey, participants were asked to confirm that they are: “an active researcher at a Danish university holding a PhD degree (or equivalent)” or are “a PhD student”. Prior to sending out the full survey, 200 researchers were randomly selected from our sample to conduct a pilot survey. They received the full survey, with the additional request to flag any mistakes or phrases that were unclear. This led to minor adjustments of the survey instrument. After concluding the survey, identifying information that had been used to contact respondents was removed, without links to other data sources. All analyses were done on this data set. The qualitative re - sponses were further reviewed to remove potentially identifying infor - mation from the published data set. 2.2. Survey instrument and respondents The full survey instrument can be found on the project’s OSF page [ 37 ]. The survey consisted of two phases. In the first phase, we collected demographic and other background variables on the participants, including gender, academic age, native language, academic field and knowledge production ways (e.g. quantitative or qualitative social sci - ences, theoretical or experimental natural science, etc.), participants’ exposure to institutional regulations and conversations about AI, and the extent to which they use GenAI either professionally or personally. In the second phase, participants were presented with 32 potential use cases of AI, divided into five research phases (see Table 1 ). For each use case, they were asked to consider if they had recently used AI for this purpose, if they were aware of colleagues with whom they had collab - orated over the last year who had done so, and whether they considered the use case to be a good or problematic research practice. The survey concluded with two open questions asking respondents whether they had one or multiple specific GenAI tools in mind when completing the survey and providing them the opportunity to leave any additional comments they wanted to share.

Gender of the non-respondents was inferred using first names and disciplinary background was inferred from non-respondents’ departmental affiliation. 2.3. Description of quantitative analyses All quantitative analyses were performed using R version 4.3.2. Multiple imputation was done using the ‘mice’ package [ 30 ]. The categorical academic age variable was constructed from a binary response on whether the respondent was a current PhD student, and a year for when the PhD-degree was awarded. We recoded these years to roughly correspond to the categories of European Research Council grant levels, so that respondents with a PhD from after 2016 are “starting”, those with a PhD before 2017 and after 2010 are “consoli - dators” and those with a PhD from before 2011 are “advanced”. For the purpose of calculating aggregated scores and imputing missing values, we also created recoded versions of all numerical values of responses to personal use and the use of others, so that the responses “No” and “Not relevant for me” were recoded to 0, “Yes” to 1, and “Don’t know” to missing value. Research integrity assessments were recoded for readability purposes only, as the value 1 corresponded to “excellent” and 7 to “very problematic”. We reversed this scale and converted the value 8 (“Unable to answer”) to missing values. The multiple imputation was done in two batches, one for the two usage groups of variables, and one for the research integrity assessment variables. As the usage variables are binary, we used logistic regression, while we used predictive mean matching for the assessments. Both batches ran through 20 iterations. The imputed data are used for both the reported aggregate scores and the factor analysis. Aggregated use scores are the mean use of an indi - vidual respondents, and corresponds to the proportion of use cases, the respondent has said “yes” to using GenAI for. The aggregated research integrity assessment is the mean value of these assessments, ranging from 1 (all use cases are rated very problematic) to 7 (all use cases are rated excellent). Factor analysis was done using the ‘psych’ package in R [ 31 ]. We used parallel analysis to identify three factors with an eigenvalue above 1. We use a maximum likelihood factoring method with varimax rota - tion, to select factors with distinct peak loadings. The resulting loadings are high, with several peaks above.6, and 49.1 % of the variance explained. While the explained variance is not exceptional, we still consider it reasonable. Adding two additional factors would only explain 5.7 % more of the variance, which would not be justifiable, and intro - duce noisy factors. Using the individual factor scores per observation, we cluster ob - servations with k-means clustering with three centres, equivalent to the number of factors. Hierarchical clustering visually supports the number of clusters. These clusters group respondents while the factor loadings group the variables. 2.4. Description of qualitative analyses The qualitative data we utilized was gathered from two open-text field questions included in the survey. The first question asked re - spondents about the types of GenAI tools they used, and the second, broader question sought their comments or insights related to using GenAI for research purposes. The responses to the first question were compiled and visualized in bar graphs, segmented by gender, PhD age, research field, and whether the researchers were mono-disciplinary or multidisciplinary ( Fig. 2 - figure supplements 1–5). As for the second question, we received a total of 543 comments (excluding responses that indicated ‘no comment’). To analyse the comments, we categorized the responses into emerging thematic groups: ’No comment’, ’Understanding of the survey or elaboration of answers’, ’Assessment of good or bad practice’, ’Description of GenAI as a tool’, ’Thoughts or issues related to policy, training, or infrastructure for GenAI’, ’Examples of use’, and ’General opinions or emotions about GenAI’. The comments and coding results can be found on the project’s OSF site [ 37 ]. Here, we have removed any identifying information from the open text fields, including names, university details, department or specific research fields, and any particular activities mentioned by re - spondents that could lead to identification. To help us analyse the three clusters identified in this paper, we specifically focused on the 182 comments coded under ’Assessment of good or bad practice’. 3.

Results The purpose of this initial study has been to document the use of GenAI and research integrity assessments among researchers. It is therefore primarily descriptive, focused on gathering data and reporting and discussing evidence. The collection of literature informing the study provided an overview of the most present empirical research evidence in this fast-developing topic area. The potential key characteristics and factors for the use of GenAI and research integrity assessments among researchers were identified, operationalized, included, and measured in the study’s data collection as reported in section two and this section. The study does not delve into potential causal factors behind differing perceptions of GenAI use, as this would require additional, nonstruc - tured data, i.e. interviews which have not yet been collected. 3.1. Descriptive overview of main results The survey was launched on January 22, 2024, and remained open until February 26, 2024, with one invitation and two reminders being sent to all researchers (incl. PhD students) of all eight Danish univer - sities. Out of the 29,498 invitations, we received 2534 complete re - sponses (8.6 %), with another 533 respondents answering part of the questions (1.8 %). In the analyses below, we only use the complete re - sponses. The survey consisted of two main parts, one with questions regarding general GenAI experience and demographic background variables, the other presenting 32 use cases across five phases of research work ( Table 1 ). For each use case, respondents were asked about their own use, the perceived use of others, and an assessment of the use case in terms of research integrity on a 7-point Likert scale from excellent research practice to very problematic research practice. Further details about the survey can be found in the methods section. Respondents were generally well spread across disciplinary back - grounds and demographics. We refer to Supplementary Table 1 - Sup - plementary Table 4 for a descriptive overview of respondents’ background and demographics relative to the study population. In this section, we present descriptive statistics on the use and research integrity assessment of the 32 cases of GenAI use in the research process. Fig. 1 presents a plot of the research integrity assessment and average use (both own use and the perceived use of colleagues) of each of the individual use cases. It shows a rather wide distribution of research integrity assessments for most use cases, indicating diverse opinions about whether using GenAI tools for these purposes constitutes problematic or good research practices. In general, respondents assessed using GenAI for language editing use cases (e.g. in proposal writing, editing of research articles, formatting references) and those related to data analysis (e.g. creating codes for analysis or simulation, pattern recognition, transcription of research recordings) as rather good research practices. In contrast, usage of GenAI for arguably more fundamental tasks related to designing research experiments or theo - retical frameworks and critical assessment of other work during peer review was considered more problematic. Two use cases that were particularly contentious were those related to the creation or modification of images and figures, and the creation of synthetic data. Both these cases might have different connotations in diverse research fields. An important observation in relation to the J.P. Andersen et al.

{"page_content": "research integrity assessment is that many respondents elaborate in the open text field of the survey [ 37 ], that their integrity assessment of the use of GenAI depends on it being used critically and reflexively. As one respondent puts it: “ Although I have answered in many cases that using AI is excellent practice, this does not mean that it should be used uncritically or without checking references etc. I just consider AI as giving an excellent head start on all of these tasks ” (ID19826). The qualitative comments, allowing respondents to contextualise their responses, contain several descriptions indicating a lack of trust in GenAI. The main problems mentioned are hallucination (that the chat - bot “ makes up ” information), violation of privacy rights and copyrights (not knowing what is allowed to be fed into e.g. GenAI tools), potential biases, and ’ black boxing ’ of the generative process. Generally, we observe a moderate positive correlation between the research integrity assessment of use cases and their admitted use by respondents (Kendall ’ s τ =.44) or their colleagues ( τ =.5). Some ex - ceptions are the use of GenAI to identify potential collaborators and to create synthetic datasets (relatively low use), and to propose a title, keyword or abstract or even help draft parts of the body of an article (with relatively high admitted use). For all use cases, the reported use of GenAI of direct colleagues is higher than that of respondents themselves, with particularly large relative differences for the two use cases related to the peer review process (identifying strengths and weaknesses of manuscripts under review and writing review reports). This is in line with what is found in other surveys, e.g. focusing on questionable research practices and malpractice [ 32 ]. Last, we note that for almost all use cases, the share of respondents indicating a use case to be a good, very good or excellent practice is higher than the share of respondents indicating to have used GenAI for this purpose. This suggests that, while reported use of GenAI is still fairly low, the reason for not engaging in more use cases of GenAI is probably not primarily related to research integrity considerations. This is further underlined by aggregated assessment and usage scores (see Supplementary Fig. 1 ), illustrating higher assessment scores, and lower variance, as usage grows. Respondents that had not used GenAI, or only had used it in very few use cases, had much higher disagreement on the assessment of the use cases on average. Fig. 2 presents the aggregated use and research integrity assessment of all 32 use cases, broken down by research field (top panel), knowl - edge production ways (second panel), gender (third panel) and aca - demic age (bottom panel). It shows relative consistency in responses across main research areas, with most users in all disciplines indicating to use GenAI tools for only few use cases. However, a somewhat larger proportion of respondents from the technical sciences, especially those in the experimental technical sciences, indicate to use GenAI for a higher number of different use cases, some even for more than half of all use cases mentioned in our survey. Simultaneously, respondents from the technical sciences have the highest aggregated research integrity assessment of our 32 use cases. In contrast, scholars from the humanities indicate to use GenAI tools least frequently and they also have the least positive research integrity assessment of the use of GenAI for research purposes. Some of the respondents from this main area of research indicate to have a strongly negative research integrity assessment of the usage of such tools for many use cases. A substantial share of re - spondents from the humanities (19.3 %) gives an overall assessment of 3 or less on a 7-point scale (i.e. degrees of ‘problematic research practice ’ ). Looking at differences within research fields, we note that quanti - tative social scientists indicate to use GenAI tools for substantially more use cases than their colleagues from the qualitative social sciences. Again, we notice the inverse pattern in terms of research integrity assessment, i.e. the qualitative social scientists giving slightly lower scores to the acceptability of using GenAI tools for various purposes. In terms of gender, no differences in either use nor ethical assessment were observed between men and women. Some variations are reported in the other two categories (non-binary and ‘do not wish to disclose ’ ), but these contain only few observations. Fig. 1.

{"page_content": "In terms of academic age, we observe a clear pattern in usage of GenAI tools, with more junior scholars using GenAI for more different purposes than their senior colleagues. In terms of research integrity assessment, no substantial differences between respondents from different academic ages were observed. This means junior scholars have been quicker to adopt GenAI tools for various use cases than their senior colleagues, even with similar assessment of the appropriateness of such usage. If we look at the GenAI tools that respondents had in mind when answering the survey, most respondents indicated to be thinking of ChatGPT (n = 1550), while 894 respondents answered ‘no ’ or did not answer the question about if they had any specific tools in mind while answering the survey ( Fig. 2 – figure supplement 1 ). Copilot (both Microsoft and GitHub) was the second most mentioned tool (n = 176). Other tools mentioned include Grammarly (n = 101), Google ’ s Bard (n = 76), Dall-E (n = 74) and DeepL (n = 69). 3.2.

{"page_content": "Fig. 7 ). We also checked the correspondence between observed and multiply imputed responses ( Supplementary Fig. 8 ) and consider the correspondence sufficient to incorporate imputed responses for a more complete data material. Factor loadings underlying the cluster analysis are available in Supplementary Fig. 9. The factor analysis revealed three clusters of research integrity assessment of GenAI use cases among respondents ( Fig. 3 ), based on a k - means clustering of individual factor scores. The clusters differentiate from each other by highlighting different types of integrity assessments of GenAI use in research. Cluster 1 could be labelled “ GenAI as a work horse ”, with 893 respondents (35.2 %). In this cluster we find re - searchers who consider using GenAI to create and edit software codes for analysis and simulation (da1-2), to support statistical analysis (da3) and to help recognize patterns in data (da4) as good research practices. On the other hand, researchers in this cluster are more sceptical towards using GenAI in the peer review process (cf. pub6 and pub7) than re - searchers in the two other clusters. They also score using GenAI in the ‘Idea generation phase ’ (idea1-5) lower than researchers in the other two clusters. If we look at the comments from researchers in this cluster, made in the open text field in the survey [ 37 ], some researchers, point out that GenAI “ is good when used for tedious tasks like formatting, editing, generating a code for idea that you have in mind, generating drafts, etc, and terrible for creative tasks ” (ID2561), that it is “ problematic to be using generative AI in creating articles or other written materials ” (ID13760), but that GenAI can be good for “ checking language and reviewing code ” (ID12608). This cluster is thereby mainly characterised by using GenAI as a tool to speed up, process, or help researchers with technical issues in relation to their research – i.e. as a “ work horse ”. In cluster 2 – tentatively called “ GenAI as a language assistant only ”, we find the most sceptical respondents (n = 609, 24.0 %). They generally assess the use of GenAI more negatively than the other clus - ters, but it is also in this cluster where we find the most “ neutral ” re - sponses. Positive assessments are mainly found for use cases related to language editing, e.g. refine and edit language of research proposals (rd3), transcribe recordings of research material (dc4) and propose ti - tles, keywords, or abstracts, edit research articles for readability and formatting references (pub3-5). Particularly, cluster 2 researchers find it more problematic to use GenAI for data analysis (da1-5) than re - searchers in the other two clusters. In the open text field comments from cluster 2, researchers provide some clarification of this pattern. Re - spondents referred to GenAI as “ a glorified spell checker ” (23440), and mentioned that it is potentially useful “ [n]ot so much in actual research, but for various kinds of help-services, especially in connections with language polishing/translation and editing ” (20622). Overall, it seems that re - searchers in this cluster are generally sceptical towards using GenAI for research purposes, potentially with the sole exceptions of using GenAI as an assistant in the more “ language related ” aspects of the research process. The positive assessments are very few and weak in this cluster. Finally, in cluster 3, which could be labelled “ GenAI as a research accelerator ”, we find 1032 researchers (40.7 %) who are generally very positive in their assessment of GenAI. They are positive about using GenAI in almost all use cases, particularly in relation to data analysis and research design. There are only a few use cases with a slightly more varied/negative assessment, e.g. the creation of synthetic datasets (dc3) and identifying ethical issues in research (dc5). Again, the comments do not directly explain why the researchers in this cluster score these use cases as they do. The comments deal with many different issues, but some researchers mention that using GenAI tools help them become more productive: “ I do believe that AI is excellent practice for increasing productivity especially in the form of content/outline SUGGESTION (not copy-pasting it for the final version of a paper as content might be faulty and is often too general), language improvement (here AI is excellent and I don ’ t see any ethical/moral problems with it as long as input data is not confidential), and generating first drafts of sections based on my own (unstructured) content/thoughts (again, I do not see any problem with that as the content still comes from me).", "metadata": {"producer": "Acrobat Distiller 8.1.0 (Windows)", "creator": "Elsevier", "creationdate": "2025-04-26T11:33:10+00:00", "crossmarkdomains[1]": "elsevier.com", "crossmarkmajorversiondate": "2010-04-23", "creationdate--text": "26th April 2025", "elsevierwebpdfspecifications": "7.0.1", "robots": "noindex", "moddate": "2025-04-26T12:24:16+00:00", "author": "Jens Peter Andersen", "doi": "10.1016/j.techsoc.2025.102813", "title": "Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) in the research process – A survey of researchers’ practices and perceptions", "keywords": "Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI),Research process,Research practice,use cases,Research integrity", "subject": "Technology in Society, 81 (2025) 102813. doi:10.1016/j.techsoc.2025.102813", "crossmarkdomains[2]": "sciencedirect.com", "crossmarkdomainexclusive": "true", "source": "data\\Generative-Artificial-Intelligence--GenAI--in-the-research-p_2025_Technology.pdf", "total_pages": 11, "page": 6, "page_label": "7", "start_index": 0}}

In terms of reported use, all three clusters follow a similar pattern regarding the use cases for which higher/lower use of GenAI is self- reported. The clusters only differentiate in the extent to which they report higher/lower use, with respondents in cluster 3 consistently reporting highest use for every use case.

If we look at the demographic distribution of respondents over the three identified clusters ( Fig. 4 ), we do not find any differences in how men and women assess the research integrity of different GenAI use cases. Similarly, there are only minor differences in how different seniority groups (PhD students, and starting, consolidated and advanced researchers) assess what is good use of GenAI. Only in relation to main areas of research and knowledge production ways, we find more pro - nounced differences. In cluster 1 – “ GenAI as a work horse ” – we find researchers from all types of epistemic backgrounds. However, researchers from the hu - manities, who work on data produced by themselves (26.4 %), clinical medical researchers (30.5 %), and theoretical natural scientists (31.7 %) are less well represented in this cluster compared to researchers working with other ways of producing knowledge, who have a representation of between 34.1 % and 40 % in cluster 1. In cluster 2 – “ GenAI as a language assistant only ” – we find a bigger proportion of humanities scholars (36.6 %) compared to the other four main areas of research (from 20.6 to 23.4 %). If we look at differences between researchers using different knowledge production ways, we similarly see that a greater proportion of the humanities scholars, who work on data produced by themselves, are to be found in cluster 2 (41.5 %), compared to the other nine knowledge production ways. However, many theoretical natural scientists (32.1 %), humanities scholars working on existing data (30.4 %), and qualitative social scientists (29.9 %) can also be found in this cluster of GenAI sceptics. Whereas, in comparison, much fewer quantitative social scientists (13.8 %), exper - imental natural scientists (17.8 %), basic medical scientists (19 %) and experimental technical scientists (19.3 %) are represented in this cluster. In cluster 3 – “ GenAI as a research accelerator ” – we find a smaller proportion of researchers from the humanities (32.9 %) compared to the other main areas of research. For example, in the technical sciences, 44.1 % of researchers belong to this cluster, and in medicine it is 42.9 %.

Discussion In this study, we set out to explore the use and assessment of GenAI in various research practices across gender, seniority, main areas of research, and knowledge production ways. The results show that there were no or only very minor differences in the use and assessment in relation to gender. Some variations were found related to seniority and bigger differences were found related to the different main areas of research. As Fig. 2 shows, both the patterns of use and assessment are fairly similar within and across main areas of research. An interesting finding of the study, which nuances these minor dif - ferences, is that we find the largest disagreement of how to assess the research integrity of particular use cases – how good a practice they are perceived to be – in the group of the non- or infrequent users. This means that the agreement in assessment increases with use and indicates that familiarity with GenAI leads to similar, usually more positive, evalua - tions. This points to a need for more training for researchers within all fields; a need which is also echoed in a number of the qualitative com - ments to the survey. This difference in use – that some use GenAI more than others – is further highlighted in the factor analysis presented above, where three main clusters of GenAI users in Danish academia are identified: “GenAI as a work horse”, “GenAI as language assistant only”, and “GenAI as a research accelerator”. Interestingly, the use patterns across the clusters are remarkably similar, but the degree of use differs. This means that the researchers in the three clusters use (and do not use) GenAI for the same things, but to a varied degree. We also observe a moderately positive correlation between research integrity assessment of use cases and re - ported use of the same cases. Our data do not allow identification of the direction of causality (i.e. whether more use creates a more positive view of GenAI or the other way around). Nevertheless, this correlation is fairly weak, and many respondents report positive assessments of use cases but no actual use of them. This suggests that non-use is often re - ported not because of research integrity concerns but due to other rea - sons, such as lack of awareness that GenAI can be used for this purpose, insufficient skills on how to use GenAI or a lack of confidence that peers will approve of GenAI usage and concerns about potential negative consequences. However, the factor analysis also reveals some interesting differ - ences between disciplines and different ways of producing knowledge across the three clusters. These differences are most pronounced in “GenAI as a research accelerator” (Cluster 3) and in Cluster 2, “GenAI as a language assistant only”. In Cluster 3, the most GenAI-positive group, we find mostly researchers from the technical and medical sciences, as well as quantitative social scientists and experimental natural scientists. In Cluster 2, on the other hand, we have more researchers from the humanities, qualitative social science, and theoretical natural science compared to other knowledge production ways. This pattern might reflect important differences in the way in which knowledge is pro - duced; in the methods used and the overall approach to doing research, including the normative frameworks associated with these diverse ap - proaches to knowledge production. This difference can be described as a difference between nomothetic and ideographic research areas ([ 33 ] [1894]) – or perhaps more pre - cisely, between more positivist ways of doing research, on the one side, and interpretative approaches on the other side. It seems clear that the more interpretivist researchers are more sceptical towards GenAI, and that they also use the “neutral” option more than the other clusters. This may be because use cases are seen as irrelevant to their research approach, e.g. generating hypotheses or suggesting experimental parameters. Our study also demonstrates the complex interplay between regulations and community norms in shaping responsible GenAI use. While top-down regulations can provide a clear framework for good research practices, their effectiveness is contingent on their alignment with the values and practices of the research community. The case of peer review exemplifies this dynamic. It is among the few use cases surveyed in our study for which clear guidelines exist, prohibiting the use of GenAI for this purpose [ 34 ]. Simultaneously, we observe that this use case is among those with the strongest moral objections, perhaps influenced by the guidelines themselves. However, it is equally plausible that the guidelines were formulated in response to perceived pre-existing community concerns. This interplay highlights the need for a balanced approach to regulating GenAI in research. While top-down frameworks may help shape standards, rigid, top-down frameworks that disregard community norms risk being ineffective or even coun - terproductive [ 35 ].

Conversely, a purely bottom-up approach may lead to inconsistent practices and tensions between diverse research areas. In addition, our respondents indicate a clear desire for more support from their institutions (e.g. training and access to relevant infrastructure), to allow for well-considered and responsible use of GenAI for research purposes. The latter touches on the wider ethical considerations of using GenAI for research purposes. As outlined by others, GenAI poses various ethical challenges to researchers [ 27 ]. Our survey adopted relatively inclusive terms to refer to such ethical considerations when asking for re - spondents’ assessments. We used the language of ‘responsible research practices’ in relation to specific research tasks, thereby likely triggering assessments of ethical aspects most closely related to integrity and pri - vacy [ 23 ]. In their responses to the open questions, some of our re - spondents nevertheless referred to wider ethical principles including those of equity, fairness and accountability. The broader impact of using GenAI, including issues such as social and climate justice and referred to as the final principle in Knoechel et al. [ 27 ] framework for responsible GenAI usage, were hardly explicitly touched upon by our respondents though. In contrast, issues such as accuracy, trustworthiness and privacy were omnipresent in our respondents’ comments. This aligns well with calls for regulation noted by ethicists Resnik and Hosseini [ 36 ]. 4.1. Limitations While our study provides valuable insights into the use and assess - ment of research integrity of GenAI in the research process across various research fields in the Danish university context, it is important to acknowledge a number of limitations that may influence the interpre - tation of the findings and their generalizability. First, there might be different interpretations among survey partici - pants of what constitutes a GenAI tool. While many researchers thought about tools like ChatGPT when filling in the survey, others had more general tools in mind like Grammarly. Other researchers note that they had highly specialized tools in mind, developed for particular research tasks. This variation can influence the reported use and research integ - rity assessments of the tools. Similar considerations might have affected the interpretation of use cases, which might have different connotations within different knowledge production ways and epistemic cultures (e.g. the creation of ‘synthetic data’). Second, the study is based on responses from a specific subset of Danish university researchers. The sample may not be fully represen - tative of the entire Danish academic community, considering potential biases in who chose to participate in the survey. The low number of respondents in certain categories, e.g., non-binary and “do not wish to disclose gender” options, also constraints the ability to draw any con - clusions for these specific groups. Moreover, respondents might under - report or overreport the use of GenAI tools and their research integrity assessments due to personal beliefs or perceived expectations. Research integrity assessments are subjective and vary based on individual values, backgrounds, and disciplinary/field norms [ 22 ]. This diversity may lead to a wide range of integrity assessments for similar use cases. The J.P. Andersen et al.

{"page_content": "distribution of research integrity assessments indicates that there are many different opinions on GenAI use, which might be influenced by individual skills and experiences, field and disciplinary standards, and personal ethics. Social desirability might, for example, have played a role in how researchers have answered. Third, the field of GenAI is evolving fast, and tools and their appli - cations can change drastically over short periods. New tools emerge and existing ones are updated, potentially changing use patterns and research integrity perceptions. Therefore, our findings should be considered a snapshot of the state of affairs at a specific time and context, not necessarily generalizable to other settings. Fourth, our study does not extensively explore the influence of cul - tural and institutional factors on the use of GenAI tools and research integrity assessment of use cases. Universities may have different pol - icies and support structures that impact on how researchers engage with the tools. Finally, while we studied a broad array of GenAI use cases, there are obviously other potential applications of GenAI in research that were not covered in our research. Future studies could expand the range of GenAI tools and use cases to provide a more comprehensive picture. 5. Conclusion and implications Based on an initial collection of empirical evidence on the use of GenAI and research integrity assessments among researchers, this study has addressed pressing issues regarding GenAI’s application, percep - tions, and ethical dilemmas in research. This provides a necessary base for, and points towards important future research still to come. Among these are e.g. augmented empirical data to identify causal factors behind diverse perceptions of GenAI use and patterns of adoption, barriers and scepticism across researchers of diverse backgrounds. Such follow up is required to provide more in-depth evidence-based interpretability and recommendations for policy and support frameworks in academia. Owing to the fast development of GenAI and its many different ap - plications for research purposes, it is currently challenging to propose clear recommendations or guidelines for its usage. Any regulations proposed are likely to become obsolete quickly due to the speed of technological advancements. Therefore, we suggest following Knoechel et al. [ 27 ] approach in drafting principles that are flexible enough for implementation across various research fields. This approach is also supported by our data, which indicates that regulations and guidelines have to take disciplinary differences (i.e. differences in knowledge production ways) into account to be effective. To ensure successful integration, we suggest developing tailored strategies for diverse research contexts, working closely together with experts in those spe - cific fields. Such a collaborative approach would ensure that strategies are tailored to the specific needs of the single research environments, thereby minimizing the risks of misalignment with the practices and experiences of individual researchers. Local workshops, focus groups, and other collaborative activities could facilitate such a process, and it is recommended to involve the research community at large, including researchers as well as learned societies, funders, publishers, and uni - versity administrations.

This is especially evident the manufacturing sector, where innovation and competitive dynamics intersect with economic and social forces. The current academic discourse predominantly focuses on the qualitative identification and analysis of coopetition attributes, leaving a significant gap for large- scale quantitative studies to enable empirical assessment. This study aims to examine the significance of three groups of coopetition attributes for coopetition performance classified into two strategic ( dynamics, paradoxi - cality ), six relational ( asymmetry, complexity, coopetition intensity, mutual dependence, strength, tensions ), and five behavioral attributes ( competition intensity, conflict, formality, investments, trust ). Using data from 1216 manufacturing firms in Poland and employing a generalized Covariance based Structural Equation Model (CB- SEM), this study offers nuanced insights to the global discourse at the intersection of technological change and social dynamics. The results indicate that the strategic attribute paradoxicality, the relational attribute strength, and most of the behavioral attributes ( trust, competition intensity, investments, formality ) positively impact coo - petition performance. Additionally, a significant negative impact of the strategic attribute dynamics was demonstrated, while no significant influence was identified for the remaining relational attributes ( asymmetry, tensions ) as well as the behavioral attribute conflict. Diverging from prior qualitative approaches, this study offers data-driven insights for decision-makers navigating societal and technological change, highlighting which at - tributes should be stimulated to enhance coopetition performance while minimizing the level of dynamics within coopetition strategies. 1. Introduction In times of rapid technological advancements coupled with profound societal transformations, businesses are increasingly navigating complex and interdependent environments. This evolving landscape has sparked growing interest in the phenomenon of coopetition, defined as \" a dy - namic and paradoxical relationship, which arises when two companies cooperate in some areas (such as strategic alliances), but simultaneously compete in other(s) [ … ] \" [1, ( Bengtsson and Kock, 2000, p.411]). As technological progress reshapes industries and global markets, coopetition has emerged as a critical strategy for driving innovation and achieving sustainable competitive advantages, particularly in fostering sustainable firm performance ( Mwesiumo, Harun, & Hogset, 2023; Veiga, Herrera-Ballesteros, & Heras-Rosas, 2024 ). Regardless of orga - nizational size, coopetition is widely recognized as essential for enhancing the performance of both large enterprises ( Amata, Dagnino, Min `a, & Picone, 2022; Czakon, Mucha-Ku ´s, & Rogalski, 2014 ) and SMEs ( Garri, 2021 ), including family-owned businesses ( Crick & Crick, 2021a ). Furthermore, the role of coopetition for firms ’ profits ( Deng, Guan, & Xu, 2021; Estrada & Dong, 2020; Liu, Li, & Li, 2015a ), * Corresponding author.

{"page_content": "performance ( Meena, Dhir, & Sushil, 2023 ), and success ( Quintana-Garcia & Benavides-Velasco, 2004; Raza-Ullah, 2021; Ric - ciardi, Zardini, Czakon, Rossignoli, & Kraus, 2022 ) underscores the growing academic interest in understanding coopetition strategies ( Dorn, Schweiger, & Albers, 2016 ). Despite the growing recognition of coopetition as a strategy with a “ performance-enhancing nature ” ( Crick & Crick, 2019, p.666), its out - comes are not without challenges. While many studies emphasize the positive impact of coopetition on firm performance ( Amata et al., 2022; Chen, Luo, & Wang, 2019; Christ, Burritt, & Varsei, 2017; Pelle - grin-Boucher, Le Roy, & Gur ˘au, 2013 ), scholars also caution that the inherent tension between simultaneous cooperation and competition can lead to strategic failure ( Bengtsson & Raza-Ullah, 2016 ). In some cases, results deviate significantly from the intended positive outcomes ( Bouncken, Fredrich, Ritala, & Kraus, 2018; Raza-Ullah, 2020 ), under - scoring the need for further research into the mechanisms of coopetition and their impact on performance. Despite extensive research on coopetition ’ s benefits and challenges, the field remains dominated by conceptual and qualitative studies ( Garri, 2021 ). A significant gap persists in understanding the mecha - nisms linking coopetition to performance. As Mwesiumo et al. (2023), p.110) note, \" there is a lack of research-based explanations for the under - lying mechanism linking these two variables \". In particular large-sample, quantitative studies are recommended ( Akpinar & Vincze, 2016; Cza - kon & Rogalski, 2014 ). Given the inherent complexity of coopetition, particularly in shaping performance through specific features attributed to it ( Bouncken et al., 2018; Crick, 2019; Raza-Ullah & Kostis, 2020 ), advancing quantitative research is crucial. While specific environmental characteristics can influence the emergence and success of coopetition ( Araujo & Franco, 2017; Klimas, Czakon, & Friedrich, 2022 ), the external environment is not the sole determinant of coopetition, coopetitive relationships, and their outcomes ( Dorn et al., 2016; Monticelli, Silveira, & Silva, 2018 ). Internal factors are equally important ( Klimas et al., 2022; Ritala & Hurmelinna-Laukkanen, 2013 ), including attributes assigned to the coopetition phenomena itself ( Klimas, Sachpazidu, & Sta ´nczyk, 2023; Kraus, Meier, Niemand, Bouncken, & Ritala, 2018 ), which are some - times synonymously referred to as characteristics ( Bengtsson & Raza-Ullah, 2016; Dorn et al., 2016; Meena et al., 2023 ) or features ( Czakon & Rogalski, 2014; Klimas, Sta ´nczyk, & Sachpazidu, 2024; Kraus et al., 2018; Tidstr ¨om & Åhman, 2006 ). At the organizational level (rather than the environmental level), these coopetition-related attri - butes are recognized as critical in determining coopetition outcomes, including performance ( Dorn et al., 2016; Raza-Ullah, 2021 ). Given that coopetition attributes have been recognized as hetero - geneous and categorizable into three groups – strategic, relational, and behavioral ( Klimas, Sta ´nczyk, & Sachpazidu, 2024, Klimas et al., 2025 ) – this study investigates the impact of 13 specific attributes on coope - tition performance. A quantitative investigation was conducted using a large-sample study of Polish manufacturing companies.

{"page_content": "including performance ( Dorn et al., 2016; Raza-Ullah, 2021 ). Given that coopetition attributes have been recognized as hetero - geneous and categorizable into three groups – strategic, relational, and behavioral ( Klimas, Sta ´nczyk, & Sachpazidu, 2024, Klimas et al., 2025 ) – this study investigates the impact of 13 specific attributes on coope - tition performance. A quantitative investigation was conducted using a large-sample study of Polish manufacturing companies. The data collection for this study was intentionally restricted to Poland, a choice driven by the recognition that coopetition is profoundly influenced by the specific context of a given country ( Czakon et al., 2014; Meena et al., 2023 ). Firstly, the Polish context is particularly relevant for exploring coopetition due to its unique combination of economic, cultural, and structural factors. As one of the largest economies in Central and Eastern Europe, Poland represents a dynamic and evolving market. Notably, the uniqueness of macro conditions including the dynamics may justify the nationally limited context of research on coopetition ( Garri, 2021 ). Secondly, Poland ’ s unique status as a transition economy, marked by its transformation from a centrally planned to a market-oriented system, provides an ideal context for studying coopetition. Its integration into the European Union has intensified competitive pressures while offering new opportunities, making coopetition a critical strategy for firms ( Czakon & Czernek, 2016; M ł ody et al.). The country ’ s diverse industrial landscape and systemic transitions further highlight its relevance for exploring how coopetition attributes influence firm performance. To test and confirm theoretical assumptions, covariance-based structural equation modeling (CB-SEM), which is recommended for theory testing and confirmation ( Hair, Matthews, Matthews, & Sarstedt, 2017 ), is employed. This study advances coopetition theory and practice in three ways. First, as Crick and Crick ( Crick & Crick, 2019 ) emphasize, the need for larger sample sizes in coopetition research is critical. Our study ad - dresses this gap by empirically exploring the quantitative impact of coopetition attributes on performance with one of the largest datasets to date. Second, our study is one of the first to examine a comprehensive set of 13 coopetition attributes – spanning strategic, relational, and behavioral categories - in the context of coopetition performance. Lastly, this study offers practical, data-driven managerial insights for leaders navigating societal and technological change by identifying which at - tributes should be strengthened or minimized to optimize coopetition performance. By doing so, we provide actionable guidance for decision-makers to intentionally shape coopetition strategies and enhance business outcomes. The remainder of the paper is structured as follows: Section two presents the theoretical framework, divided into three subsections of the literature review. These subsections address the polymorphism of at - tributes associated with the coopetition phenomena and the coopetition performance of coopetitors, concluding with the formulation of hy - potheses. Section three outlines the methodological design, while sec - tion four presents the results of the data analysis. Section five discusses the findings, followed by conclusions in section six. 2. Theoretical background 2.1. Polymorphism of coopetition attributes To gain a profound understanding of the interplay between coope - tition and performance, it is crucial to examine the specific attributes that shape coopetition ( Dorn et al., 2016; Raza-Ullah, 2020, 2021 ). The current academic discussion unveils that these attributes can be cate - gorized into three main types: (1) strategic coopetition attributes ( dy - namic s and paradoxicality ) ( Klimas, Sta ´nczyk, & Sachpazidu, 2024 ), (2) relational coopetition attributes ( asymmetry, complexity, coopetition in - tensity, mutual dependence, strength, and tensions ) ( Klimas, Sta ´nczyk, & Sachpazidu, 2024 ), and (3) behavioral coopetition attributes ( competi - tion intensity, conflict, formality, investments, and trust ) ( Klimas et al., 2025 ). In the literature, significant attention has been devoted to emotional ( Gernsheimer et al., 2021, 2024a; Ricciardi et al., 2022; Xue, Liu, Geng, Yuan, & Chao, 2023 ) and strategic attributes ( Crick & Crick, 2021b; Gernsheimer et al., 2021, 2024a ) and their connections in the context of", "metadata": {"producer": "Acrobat Distiller 8.1.0 (Windows)", "creator": "Elsevier", "creationdate": "2025-04-26T10:33:58+00:00", "crossmarkdomains[1]": "elsevier.com", "crossmarkmajorversiondate": "2010-04-23", "creationdate--text": "26th April 2025", "elsevierwebpdfspecifications": "7.0.1", "robots": "noindex", "moddate": "2025-04-26T10:50:31+00:00", "author": "Patrycja Klimas", "doi": "10.1016/j.techsoc.2025.102819", "title": "Decoding coopetition performance using impactful coopetition attributes: Evidence from manufacturing companies", "keywords": "Coopetition,Coopetition success,Coopetition performance,Coopetition attributes,CB-SEM,Large-scale survey,Manufacturing companies", "subject": "Technology in Society, 81 (2025) 102819. doi:10.1016/j.techsoc.2025.102819", "crossmarkdomains[2]": "sciencedirect.com", "crossmarkdomainexclusive": "true", "source": "data\\Decoding-coopetition-performance-using-impactful-coopetitio_2025_Technology-.pdf", "total_pages": 15, "page": 1, "page_label": "2", "start_index": -1}}
{"page_content": "& Sachpazidu, 2024 ), (2) relational coopetition attributes ( asymmetry, complexity, coopetition in - tensity, mutual dependence, strength, and tensions ) ( Klimas, Sta ´nczyk, & Sachpazidu, 2024 ), and (3) behavioral coopetition attributes ( competi - tion intensity, conflict, formality, investments, and trust ) ( Klimas et al., 2025 ). In the literature, significant attention has been devoted to emotional ( Gernsheimer et al., 2021, 2024a; Ricciardi et al., 2022; Xue, Liu, Geng, Yuan, & Chao, 2023 ) and strategic attributes ( Crick & Crick, 2021b; Gernsheimer et al., 2021, 2024a ) and their connections in the context of coopetitive performance ( Raza-Ullah, 2020 ). While notable importance is placed on trust ( Crick, 2019; Czakon & Czernek, 2016; Gernsheimer et al., 2021, 2024a; Raza-Ullah & Kostis, 2020 ) and the paradoxical nature of this relationship ( Gernsheimer et al., 2021; Rai, Gnyawali, & Bhatt, 2023; Raza-Ullah, 2020; Xue et al., 2023 ), other attributes remain rarely investigated, systematized or ordered. Researchers have also highlighted the lack of quantitative research in this area ( Crick & Crick, 2019; Gernsheimer et al., 2021; Klimas et al., 2023 ), particularly studies adopting a multidimensional approach considering a broader spectrum of attributes and its impact on coopetition performance. Considering the literature on coopetition more broadly, the main focus is on the features attributed to coopetition, coopetitors and coo - petitive relationships ( Bouncken et al., 2018; Czakon et al., 2014, 2020; Garri, 2021; Gernsheimer et al., 2021, 2024a; Jakobsen, 2020; Lascaux, 2020; Osarenkhoe, 2010; Raza-Ullah & Kostis, 2020 ). This aligns with the findings of SLRs ( Czakon et al., 2014; Gast, Filser, Gundolf, & Kraus, 2015 ), which emphasize that coopetitors ’ performance is determined by the adaptation of coopetition strategies ( Le Roy & Czakon, 2016 ), coo - petitive relationships ( Gernsheimer, Gast, & Kanbach, 2024; Raza-Ullah, P. Klimas et al.

{"page_content": "2021 ), and coopetitive behaviors ( Zhao, Renard, Elmoukhliss, & Bala - gue, 2016 ). 2.1.1. Strategic coopetition attributes Environmental changes can generate and affect new strategies, creating coopetitive advantages ( Padula & Dagnino, 2007 ). Being trig - gered by changes within the industry and business environment ( Akpinar & Vincze, 2016 ), the simultaneous existence of cooperation and competition inherently makes the coopetition strategy dynamic ( Akpinar & Vincze, 2016; Araujo & Franco, 2017; Chen et al., 2019; Crick & Crick, 2019; Gernsheimer, Gast, & Kanbach, 2024; Luo, 2004 ). These dynamics reveal coopetition as a strategic process in which actors create value through continuous cooperative interactions ( Bouncken, Gast, Kraus, & Bogers, 2015; Cozzolino & Rothaermel, 2018; Gern - sheimer et al., 2021, 2024a; Monticelli et al., 2018 ), evolving over time as firms build trust and develop routines. At the same time, coopetition causes paradoxes in the interaction process, and \" strategies of managing paradoxical tension and balancing between competition and cooperation become crucial, determining the way rival partners can compete and coop - erate simultaneously \" (Peng et al., 2018, p. 352). Therefore, dynamics and paradoxicality are considered strategic attributes of coopetition ( Klimas, Sta ´nczyk, & Sachpazidu, 2024 ). 2.1.2. Relational coopetition attributes The second group of attributes is related to coopetition relationships, referring to the actions of the parties involved ( Klimas, Sta ´nczyk, & Sachpazidu, 2024 ). First, scholars highlight that resource asymmetries can strengthen coopetition relationships ( Jakobsen, 2020; Meena et al., 2023; Monticelli et al., 2018; Yoo, Roh, Cho, & Yang, 2022 ). Asymmetry implies unequal dependence between coopetitors often linked to power imbalances ( Jakobsen, 2020; Lechner, Soppe, & Dowling, 2016; Munten, Vanhamme, Maon, Swaen, & Lindgreen, 2021 ), unequal ben - efits ( Jakobsen, 2020; Monticelli et al., 2018 ), or differences in size between the parties ( Quintana-Garcia & Benavides-Velasco, 2004; Yoo et al., 2019, 2022 ). Nonetheless, such asymmetries often lead to more cooperative actions ( Kwon, Kang, Kim, & Choi, 2020; Osarenkhoe, 2010 ). Second, as noted by Czakon et al. ( Czakon et al., 2014 ), 57% of papers on coopetition point to complexity when discussing coopetition attributes, rooted in the number and variety of individual actors involved ( Geurts, Broekhuizen, Dolfsma, & Cepa, 2022 ), accounting for the contradictory results in coopetition relationships ( Bouncken et al., 2018 ). The third attribute, intensity, shapes the interdependencies be - tween coopetitors, strengthening and stabilizing relationships by reducing opportunism and conflicts ( Lechner et al., 2016 ). It also reflects the potential benefits of cooperation within these relationships ( Rai et al., 2023 ), while maintaining high levels of competition ( Chen et al., 2019 ) across various products ( Rai et al., 2023 ). Mutual dependence, the fourth attribute, is crucial for the longevity of coopetition relationships as it explains how firms \" continue to cooperate over time \" (Jakobsen, 2020, p. 257). It ensures balance, as the parties exert equal influence on each other ( Muthusamy & Dass, 2021 ), both structurally and psychologically ( Jakobsen, 2020 ). The fifth attribute, strength, refers to the combination of protective mechanisms in collaboration with competitors ( Ritala & Hurmelinna-Laukkanen, 2013 ), often manifesting in close, informal re - lationships, such as defending a coopetitor against external threats and supporting their long-term success ( Shi, Shi, Chan, & Wang, 2009 ). Finally, tensions inherent in the paradox of coopetition represent the sixth relational attribute ( Jakobsen,", "metadata": {"producer": "Acrobat Distiller 8.1.0 (Windows)", "creator": "Elsevier", "creationdate": "2025-04-26T10:33:58+00:00", "crossmarkdomains[1]": "elsevier.com", "crossmarkmajorversiondate": "2010-04-23", "creationdate--text": "26th April 2025", "elsevierwebpdfspecifications": "7.0.1", "robots": "noindex", "moddate": "2025-04-26T10:50:31+00:00", "author": "Patrycja Klimas", "doi": "10.1016/j.techsoc.2025.102819", "title": "Decoding coopetition performance using impactful coopetition attributes: Evidence from manufacturing companies", "keywords": "Coopetition,Coopetition success,Coopetition performance,Coopetition attributes,CB-SEM,Large-scale survey,Manufacturing companies", "subject": "Technology in Society, 81 (2025) 102819. doi:10.1016/j.techsoc.2025.102819", "crossmarkdomains[2]": "sciencedirect.com", "crossmarkdomainexclusive": "true", "source": "data\\Decoding-coopetition-performance-using-impactful-coopetitio_2025_Technology-.pdf", "total_pages": 15, "page": 2, "page_label": "3", "start_index": 0}}
{"page_content": "2019 ) across various products ( Rai et al., 2023 ). Mutual dependence, the fourth attribute, is crucial for the longevity of coopetition relationships as it explains how firms \" continue to cooperate over time \" (Jakobsen, 2020, p. 257). It ensures balance, as the parties exert equal influence on each other ( Muthusamy & Dass, 2021 ), both structurally and psychologically ( Jakobsen, 2020 ).

Finally, tensions inherent in the paradox of coopetition represent the sixth relational attribute ( Jakobsen, 2020; Liu, Yang, & Zhang, 2021 ). These tensions arise from competing demands, such as balancing cooperation and competition, maintaining closeness while preserving distance, sharing knowledge while protecting it, or navigating the trade-off between value creation and value appropriation ( Raza-Ullah, 2020 ). 2.1.3. Behavioral coopetition attributes There remain individual layers of relational substance ( Osarenkhoe, 2010 ), individual differences ( Ritala & Hurmelinna-Laukkanen, 2013 ), internal behavioral mechanism ( Czakon et al., 2020 ), and individual coopetitive behaviors ( Corbo et al., 2023; Crick, 2021; Klimas et al., 2025 ) that initiate coopetition and influence its success ( Garri, 2021 ). Behavioral attributes result from the actions and interactions of coope - titors within their relationships ( Klimas et al., 2025 ). First, since coopetition requires a balancing act between cooperation and competition, adopting an active competitive stance is vital ( Bouncken et al., 2018, 2020; Chen & Miller, 2012 ). Increased cooper - ation positively correlates with innovation and coopetitive success, while competition can range from low to high in intensity. This attribute is critical, as individual actors ’ competitive attitude shape power dy - namics ( Arantes da Costa, Pascoli Bottura, Maurício Gama Boaventura, & Am ´erico Fischmann, 2009 ). Second, dependence can be a source of conflict at the individual level ( Osarenkhoe, 2010; Tidstr ¨om, 2014 ) particularly in role conflicts ( Jakobsen, 2020 ) such as intra-partner, inter-role, inter-partner and personal conflicts ( Bengtsson & Kock, 2014 ). Sharma et al. ( Sharma, Young, & Wilkinson, 2015 ) observe: \" lack of conflict ( … ) provides an environment for personal and social interactions to take place, leading to the development of mutual, positive sentiments, such as liking and respect \" (Sharma et al., 2015, p. 49). Reduced conflict promotes harmonious and successful relationships ( Leonidou, Katsikeas, & Hadjimarcou, 2002 ). Third, formalization may serve as a mechanism to manage tensions in competitive relationships ( Amata et al., 2022 ). Formal agreements become particularly important when the risk of coopetition is high, especially for weaker parties ( Dorn et al., 2016 ). Such \" formal safe - guarding \" (Dorn et al., 2016, p. 489) offers certainty and protection, which fosters innovation ( Liu et al., 2021 ). Fourth, the uncertainties of coopetition can be mitigated through mutual investment, which leading to greater efficiency ( Liu, Li, & Li, 2015b ) and enhanced performance ( Jakobsen, 2020 ). These in - vestments include efforts and resources directed towards learning about the systems, procedures, and products, as well as adapting offerings to complement the competitor ’ s ( Jap & Anderson, 2007; Kam & Lai, 2018; Klimas et al., 2023; Kusari, Hoeffler, & Iacobucci, 2013 ). Fifth, fostering trust through information and knowledge sharing is crucial ( Bengtsson & Raza-Ullah, 2016; Dorn et al., 2016; Lascaux, 2020; Monticelli et al., 2018 ). As Jakobsen emphasizes, \" trust can fill the gaps in the formal contracts and help to keep the relationship running \" (Jakobsen,", "metadata": {"producer": "Acrobat Distiller 8.1.0 (Windows)", "creator": "Elsevier", "creationdate": "2025-04-26T10:33:58+00:00", "crossmarkdomains[1]": "elsevier.com", "crossmarkmajorversiondate": "2010-04-23", "creationdate--text": "26th April 2025", "elsevierwebpdfspecifications": "7.0.1", "robots": "noindex", "moddate": "2025-04-26T10:50:31+00:00", "author": "Patrycja Klimas", "doi": "10.1016/j.techsoc.2025.102819", "title": "Decoding coopetition performance using impactful coopetition attributes: Evidence from manufacturing companies", "keywords": "Coopetition,Coopetition success,Coopetition performance,Coopetition attributes,CB-SEM,Large-scale survey,Manufacturing companies", "subject": "Technology in Society, 81 (2025) 102819. doi:10.1016/j.techsoc.2025.102819", "crossmarkdomains[2]": "sciencedirect.com", "crossmarkdomainexclusive": "true", "source": "data\\Decoding-coopetition-performance-using-impactful-coopetitio_2025_Technology-.pdf", "total_pages": 15, "page": 2, "page_label": "3", "start_index": -1}}

As Jakobsen emphasizes, \" trust can fill the gaps in the formal contracts and help to keep the relationship running \" (Jakobsen, 2020, p. 253). It is a key attribute for coopetition success ( Osarenkhoe, 2010 ), enabling joint risk-taking ( Akpinar & Vincze, 2016 ), and driving innovation and performance ( Lascaux, 2020 ). However, it is worth noting that the simultaneous consideration of rational and behavioral aspects in coopetition literature is relatively uncommon. In some cases, coopetition strategies are reduced to behavioral dimensions ( Crick, 2021 ). While such behaviors are inherent in every coopetitive relationship ( Corbo et al., 2023 ), behavioral mechanisms often support rather than replace the strategic, rational decisions made by coopetiting firms ( Czakon et al., 2020 ). Table 1 provides a summary of the three categories of coopetition attributes discussed. 2.2. Performance of coopetitors Performance is consistently highlighted as a key outcome within the context of coopetition ( Bouncken & Kraus, 2013; Crick, 2019; Dorn et al., 2016 ). Coopetition performance represents a unique and com - plementary dimension of organizational success, derived from adopting coopetition strategies, and it directly influences overall firm perfor - mance ( Klimas, Gadomska-Lila, & Sachpazidu, 2024 ). In the literature, coopetition performance is examined through various perspectives, including functional ( Gnyawali & Park, 2009; Ritala & Hurmelinna-Laukkanen, 2009 ), relational ( Bengtsson & Kock, 2000; Peng, Yen, & Bourne, 2018 ), and temporal approaches ( Raza-Ullah, 2020; Ricciardi et al., 2022 ), as well as paradoxical cooperation focused P.

{"page_content": "on financial performance ( Bouncken & Kraus, 2013; Monticelli et al., 2018; Peng et al., 2018 ). It should be emphasized that coopetition per - formance is inseparable from the concept of coopetition itself and is attributed exclusively to those adopting respective strategies, engaging in coopetitive behaviors, or leveraging coopetitive relationships in an emergent manner ( Bouncken & Fredrich, 2012; Klimas, Gadomska-Lila, & Sachpazidu, 2024; Rai et al., 2023; Raza-Ullah, 2020; Raza-Ullah & Kostis, 2020 ). Consolidating insights from various scholars ( Bouncken et al., 2015; Bouncken & Fredrich, 2012; Rai et al., 2023; Raza-Ullah, 2020, 2021; Ricciardi et al., 2022 ), Klimas et al. (2024) propose an integrative un - derstanding of coopetition performance. They define it as management ’ s assessment of a firm ’ s success stemming from its cooperative and competitive interactions. Coopetition performance reflects a company ’ s ability to achieve or exceed expected outcomes of coopetition, gener - ating benefits in financial, market, innovation, customer, and resource aspects, thereby enhancing both the company ’ s short- and long-term competitiveness. This conceptual framework is adopted in the present study. 2.3. Hypotheses development Previous research has indicated that the success of coopetition, and thus its beneficial impact on firm performance, may depend on the specific attributes of coopetition itself ( Bouncken et al., 2018; Crick, 2019; Raza-Ullah, 2021; Raza-Ullah & Kostis, 2020; Ricciardi et al., 2022; Veiga et al., 2024 ). Several studies have also identified certain attributes as critical success factors in coopetition ( Dorn et al., 2016; Garri, 2021; Geurts et al., 2022; Osarenkhoe, 2010; Peng et al., 2018; Raza-Ullah, 2020 ). Moreover, it is essential to consider these attributes at different levels of coopetition, as individual actors influence organi - zational decision-making, which, in turn, co-creates value at the in - dustry level ( Garri, 2021 ). Therefore, the general hypothesis posited is that the attributes related to coopetition positively impact coopetition performance. As Monticelli et al. ( Monticelli et al., 2018 ) highlight, the strength of coopetition lies in its ability to generate success in response to external environmental changes. The coopetition strategy has garnered growing interest as it integrates both competition and cooperation, which are crucial for achieving positive coopetition outcomes such as value co-creation ( Garri, 2021; Rai et al., 2023 ), superior value creation ( Kostis, Albers, Vanderstraeten, Chinchanikar, & Bengtsson, 2024 ), effectiveness ( Le Roy & Czakon, 2016 ), innovation ( Czakon et al., 2014; Dorn et al., 2016 ), long-term success ( Eriksson, 2008; Monticelli et al., 2018 ), longevity ( Peng et al., 2018 ) and even survival ( Vlaisavljevic, Gopalakrishnan, Zhang, Cabello-Medina, & Guilbault, 2022 ). A coopetition strategy enables coopetitors to leverage both cooperation and competition to improve performance ( Kwon et al., 2020 ). The success of the coopetition strategy depends on balancing coop - eration and competition ( Christ et al., 2017; Eriksson, 2008; Garri, 2021; Kostis et al., 2024; Lado, Boyd, & Hanlon, 1997 ), particularly during the dynamic evolution of these relationships ( Czakon & Rogalski, 2014; Luo, 2004; Peng et al., 2018 ). The strategic paradox of coopetition creates opportunities to achieve maximum performance when this balance is successfully maintained ( Peng et al., 2018 ). Thus, the paradoxical nature of coopetition can have a positive impact ( Bouncken et al., 2018 ), pro - vided that the tension between cooperation and competition is managed effectively ( Gernsheimer, Kanbach, Gast, & Le Roy, 2024;", "metadata": {"producer": "Acrobat Distiller 8.1.0 (Windows)", "creator": "Elsevier", "creationdate": "2025-04-26T10:33:58+00:00", "crossmarkdomains[1]": "elsevier.com", "crossmarkmajorversiondate": "2010-04-23", "creationdate--text": "26th April 2025", "elsevierwebpdfspecifications": "7.0.1", "robots": "noindex", "moddate": "2025-04-26T10:50:31+00:00", "author": "Patrycja Klimas", "doi": "10.1016/j.techsoc.2025.102819", "title": "Decoding coopetition performance using impactful coopetition attributes: Evidence from manufacturing companies", "keywords": "Coopetition,Coopetition success,Coopetition performance,Coopetition attributes,CB-SEM,Large-scale survey,Manufacturing companies", "subject": "Technology in Society, 81 (2025) 102819. doi:10.1016/j.techsoc.2025.102819", "crossmarkdomains[2]": "sciencedirect.com", "crossmarkdomainexclusive": "true", "source": "data\\Decoding-coopetition-performance-using-impactful-coopetitio_2025_Technology-.pdf", "total_pages": 15, "page": 3, "page_label": "4", "start_index": 0}}
{"page_content": "competition to improve performance ( Kwon et al., 2020 ). The success of the coopetition strategy depends on balancing coop - eration and competition ( Christ et al., 2017; Eriksson, 2008; Garri, 2021; Kostis et al., 2024; Lado, Boyd, & Hanlon, 1997 ), particularly during the dynamic evolution of these relationships ( Czakon & Rogalski, 2014; Luo, 2004; Peng et al., 2018 ). The strategic paradox of coopetition creates opportunities to achieve maximum performance when this balance is successfully maintained ( Peng et al., 2018 ). Thus, the paradoxical nature of coopetition can have a positive impact ( Bouncken et al., 2018 ), pro - vided that the tension between cooperation and competition is managed effectively ( Gernsheimer, Kanbach, Gast, & Le Roy, 2024; Jakobsen, 2020 ). Hence, we hypothesize as follows: Hypothesis 1. (H1): Strategic coopetition attributes positively impact coopetition performance. Peng et al. ( Peng et al., 2018 ) state that the essence of coopetition is to maintain sustainable, long-term relationships that generate mutual benefits and value creation. Garri ( Garri, 2021 ) adds that valuable coopetitive relationships are grounded in openness, ongoing communi - cation, resource sharing, and trust-building activities for mutual bene - fits. These relationships can yield positive effects on performance through interaction ( Monticelli et al., 2018; Park & Kim, 2021 ). Inter - estingly, asymmetry between coopetitors can be beneficial for coopeti - tion success ( Jakobsen, 2020 ), as it offers complementary strengths ( Jakobsen, 2020; Kwon et al., 2020; Monticelli et al., 2018; Osarenkhoe, 2010 ), contributing to innovation and success. Additionally, the in - tensity and complexity of relationships reflect coopetition ’ s advantages ( Geurts et al., 2022; Mariani & Belitski, 2023 ), often driving innovative outcomes ( Bouncken et al., 2018 ). However, the paradoxical nature of coopetitive relationships can result in tensions ( Bouncken et al., 2018; Dorn et al., 2016; Gernsheimer, Kanbach, et al., 2024; Ritala & Hurmelinna-Laukkanen, 2009; Tidstr ¨om, 2014 ), which, while chal - lenging, may also in turn lead to positive consequences for efficiency and innovation ( Jakobsen, 2020; Raza-Ullah, 2020 ). Dependence is frequently cited as the primary source of tension ( Jakobsen, 2020; Rajala & Tidstr ¨om, 2021; Tidstr ¨om, 2014 ). Jakobsen ( Jakobsen, 2020 ) posits that mutual dependence, facilitated by joint actions and high-quality information exchange, can influence knowledge distribu - tion among partners and is vital for firm performance. Considering the impact of the relational attributes of coopetition, we hypothesize as follows: Hypothesis 2. (H2): Relational coopetition attributes positively impact coopetition performance. Individual attributes also shape coopetitive relationships as they stem from individuals ’ expectations \" but differ markedly in the objects of the individuals ’ positive feelings \" (Lascaux, 2020, p. 9). Some studies suggest that the dominance of competition over collaboration can hinder coopetition performance ( Czakon et al., 2014 ). While cooperation may yield early-stage benefits in coopetition ( Park & Kim, 2021 ), as re - lationships evolve, competition becomes more significant for achieving success ( Peng et al., 2018 ) and plays a vital role in coopetition effec - tiveness ( Bengtsson & Kock, 1999 ). Emerging tensions from coopetitive relationships can lead to role conflicts ( Dorn et al., 2016 ), and generally, the absence of such conflicts fosters a positive atmosphere for coopeti - tion success ( Leonidou et al., 2002; Sharma et al., 2015 ). The absence of conflicts is directly linked to value-based commitment ( Sharma et al., 2015 ), fostering trust in relationships ( Lechner et al., 2016 ). Trust is a key driver of coopetition success ( Christ et al., 2017; Czakon & Czernek, 2016; Dorn et al.,", "metadata": {"producer": "Acrobat Distiller 8.1.0 (Windows)", "creator": "Elsevier", "creationdate": "2025-04-26T10:33:58+00:00", "crossmarkdomains[1]": "elsevier.com", "crossmarkmajorversiondate": "2010-04-23", "creationdate--text": "26th April 2025", "elsevierwebpdfspecifications": "7.0.1", "robots": "noindex", "moddate": "2025-04-26T10:50:31+00:00", "author": "Patrycja Klimas", "doi": "10.1016/j.techsoc.2025.102819", "title": "Decoding coopetition performance using impactful coopetition attributes: Evidence from manufacturing companies", "keywords": "Coopetition,Coopetition success,Coopetition performance,Coopetition attributes,CB-SEM,Large-scale survey,Manufacturing companies", "subject": "Technology in Society, 81 (2025) 102819. doi:10.1016/j.techsoc.2025.102819", "crossmarkdomains[2]": "sciencedirect.com", "crossmarkdomainexclusive": "true", "source": "data\\Decoding-coopetition-performance-using-impactful-coopetitio_2025_Technology-.pdf", "total_pages": 15, "page": 3, "page_label": "4", "start_index": -1}}

Formalization promotes the achievement of common goals ( Osarenkhoe, 2010 ) and supports innovation ( Liu et al., 2021 ). Joint investments directly enhance the effectiveness of coopetition ( Liu et al., 2015b ) and performance ( Jakobsen, 2020 ). Hence, we hypothesize as follows: Hypothesis 3. (H3): Behavioral coopetition attributes positively impact coopetiton performance. Fig. 1 presents an integrated view of the hypotheses, illustrating the relationships between the three different types of coopetition attributes and coopetition performance. 3. Methodological design This study investigates the significance of coopetition attributes for coopetition performance as part of a long-term research project. This project involved (1) identifying and categorizing coopetition attributes through a systematic literature review ( Klimas et al., 2023 ), (2) veri - fying these attributes and proposing operationalizations through focus group interviews ( Klimas, Gadomska-Lila, & Sachpazidu, 2024; Klimas, Sachpazidu, Sta ´nczyk, Kawa, & Nadolny, 2025; Klimas, Sta ´nczyk, & Sachpazidu, 2024, and (3) testing the developed operationalizations in a large-scale quantitative study to assess their impact on coopetition performance, with the latter being the focus of this research paper. In the quantitative phase, we examine how three groups of coopetition attri - butes - strategic, relational, and behavioral – influence coopetition performance. 3.1. Sampling and data collection The study focuses on the manufacturing industry, given the high relevance and applicability of coopetition within this sector ( Kraus, Schmid, & Gast, 2017; Pereira & Leit ˜ao, 2016 ), where innovation and competitive dynamics intersect with economic and social forces. Thus, Polish manufacturers with experience in implementing coopetition strategies were targeted, and additional filtering questions were used to identify past coopetition experiences and the duration of strategic cooperation with competitors. The gathered large sample consisted of 1231 manufacturing companies classified according to the Polish Clas - sification of Business Activity. 1 In total, these comprise 13 sections of the Polish Classification of Activities: food products manufacturing, beverage manufacturing, tobacco products manufacturing, textile products manufacturing, clothing manufacturing, leather and leather products manufacturing, manufacturing of wood and cork products, excluding furniture; manufacturing of straw and woven material prod - ucts, paper and paper products manufacturing, printing and reproduc - tion of recorded media, furniture manufacturing, other products manufacturing, manufacturing of basic pharmaceutical substances and pharmaceutical products, manufacturing of computers, electronic and optical products. Data was collected following the single-informant approach, with informants being individuals knowledgeable about the company ’ s cooperation with direct and/or indirect competitors. This included personnel in managerial positions (N = 600), those responsible for executing cooperation at the operational level (N = 626), and others (N = 5). Data was gathered by a research agency using a mixed-mode approach, integrating three data collection techniques: computer- assisted telephone interviews (CATI), computer-assisted website in - terviews (CAWI) and computer-assisted website interviews supported by telephone. The data collection took place between January and February 2023. 3.2. Measurement of variables The independent variables in our study – strategic, relational, and behavioral coopetition attributes – were measured using theory-based multi-item scales verified through focus group interviews ( Klimas, Sta ´nczyk, & Sachpazidu, 2024, Klimas et al., 2025 ). First, strategic at - tributes were assessed using 14 items: dynamics (7 items) and paradox - icality (7 items). Second, relational attributes were measured using 41 items: asymmetry (6 items), complexity (5 items), coopetition intensity (12 items), mutual dependence (5 items), strength (8 items), and tensions (5 items). Third, behavioral attributes were measured using 28 items: competition intensity (6 items), conflict (6 items), formality (5 items), in - vestments (5 items), and trust (6 items). The survey questionnaire with basic validity measures is provided in the appendix. Coopetition performance as the dependent variable was measured using 9 items, including 6 items used by Raza-Ullah ( Raza-Ullah, 2020, 2021 ) and Raza-Ullah and Kostis (", "metadata": {"producer": "Acrobat Distiller 8.1.0 (Windows)", "creator": "Elsevier", "creationdate": "2025-04-26T10:33:58+00:00", "crossmarkdomains[1]": "elsevier.com", "crossmarkmajorversiondate": "2010-04-23", "creationdate--text": "26th April 2025", "elsevierwebpdfspecifications": "7.0.1", "robots": "noindex", "moddate": "2025-04-26T10:50:31+00:00", "author": "Patrycja Klimas", "doi": "10.1016/j.techsoc.2025.102819", "title": "Decoding coopetition performance using impactful coopetition attributes: Evidence from manufacturing companies", "keywords": "Coopetition,Coopetition success,Coopetition performance,Coopetition attributes,CB-SEM,Large-scale survey,Manufacturing companies", "subject": "Technology in Society, 81 (2025) 102819. doi:10.1016/j.techsoc.2025.102819", "crossmarkdomains[2]": "sciencedirect.com", "crossmarkdomainexclusive": "true", "source": "data\\Decoding-coopetition-performance-using-impactful-coopetitio_2025_Technology-.pdf", "total_pages": 15, "page": 4, "page_label": "5", "start_index": 0}}

( Klimas, Gadomska-Lila, & Sachpazidu, 2024 ). However, during preliminary analyses, one of the items recommended by Klimas et al. ( Klimas, Gadomska-Lila, & Sach - pazidu, 2024 ), namely q0029_0009, was excluded from the analysis as it disrupted the structure of the measure model by generating unexpected negative results. Consequently, the dependent variable was measured using 8 indicators (see Appendix, Table A). Most measurements took the form of positive statements. In some exceptions, reverse coding was applied. Typically, as for research in social sciences and those applying structural equation modelling, a 7- point Likert scale (ranging from 1 – \" strongly disagree \" to 7 – \" strongly agree \" with the central level of 4 – \" neither agree nor disagree/I do not know)\" was used in our survey questionnaire. 3.3. Preliminary data analysis Preliminary data analysis aimed as assessing the quality of raw data quality revealed no missing values. However, one duplicate and fourteen outliers were removed, leaving a final sample of 1216 observations for hypothesis testing. Tests for normality following Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Shapiro-Wilk indicated a non-normal distribution, but acceptable levels of kurtosis (kurtosis < 2; the lowest absolute kurtosis value in the dataset = 0.009 while the highest = 1.405) and skewness (skewness < 1; the lowest absolute skewness value in the dataset = 0.047 while the highest = 0.950) suggested the data approximated normality. Reliability (using Cronbach ’ s alpha), validity (using average vari - ance extracted (AVE), and composite reliability (CR) were tested, showing that dependent and independent variables were reliable and valid, except for two relational attributes (coopetition intensity and mutual dependences). In general, they show that our independent and dependent variables are reliable (all considered variables) and valid (except for two relational attributes, namely coopetition intensity and mutual dependence). 3.4. Core data analysis We employed structural equation modeling (SEM) to test our hy - potheses ( Hair, Black, Babin, Anderson, & Tatham, 2019 ). Specifically, we used Covariance-based SEM (CB-SEM), which is suitable for theory-driven research, not intended to make predictions. We used a reflective approach in measurement, and our sample was large ( Hair et al., 2017 ). This approach allowed us to examine directional and complex relationships between the variables by comparing covariance matrices of theoretical and empirical measures and assessing the degree of fit of the model. Model fit was assessed and revised where necessary to meet the fit criteria. Once the model met the criteria, conclusions were drawn from the analysis. We conducted SEM using IBM SPSS Amos (ver. 24), integrated with the IBM SPSS Statistics package. 1 https://www.biznes.gov.pl/pl/tabela-pkd. P. Klimas et al.

{"page_content": "4. Results Given that all three attributes of coopetition strategy consist of latent variables, and each is assumed to impact coopetition performance, we developed three structural models in IBM SPSS Amos, with each focusing on specific hypotheses formulated in our study. The results for each model are presented in the following section. All models were validated. 4.1. Strategic attributes First, we analyzed reliability and tested for convergent and discriminant validity. Cronbach ’ s alpha values for the variables were within the acceptable range of 0.7 – 0.95, confirming the reliability of the developed measures ( Tavakol & Dennick, 2011 ). To assess convergent validity, we examined standardized factor loadings, composite reli - ability (CR), and average variance extracted (AVE). All standardized factor loadings, except for item q0024_0007 referring to paradoxicality, exceeded 0.5. This item was subsequently removed from the model. The CR values of both variables were greater than 0.7 ( Bagozzi, Yi, & Phil - lips, 1991 ). The recommended AVE level (at or above 0.50) was ach - ieved for dynamics. Although the AVE for paradoxicality was below 0.5, the construct ’ s convergent validity is still considered adequate if the AVE is at least 0.40 and the CR is higher than 0.60 ( Fornell & Larcker, 1981 ), thereby meeting the convergent validity criterion. Next, we tested for discriminant validity by comparing the squared correlations of each construct with AVE. The squared correlations were less than the AVE, discriminant validity was confirmed, which can be seen in Table 2. Based on this positive model validation, we constructed a structural model for the strategic attributes. To enhance the quality of the model fit, a modification index (MI) analysis is recommended ( MacCallum, Roznowski, & Necowitz, 1992 ). If MI > 4, the covariance of errors within the given factor can be determined. In our model, we assumed a more restrictive criterion, where MI > 10. The model, including corre - lation strengths, standardized factor loadings, and associated errors is visualized in Fig. 2. We assessed the model ’ s goodness of fit, which demonstrated strong alignment with the observed data. The chi-square (CMIN/DF) of 2.319, well below the acceptable maximum threshold of 5, and a significance level of p < 0.001 indicate that the model is statistically significant, robust and well-balanced, avoiding unnecessary complexity. The Goodness-of-Fit Index (GFI) of 0.971 and its adjusted counterpart, the Adjusted Goodness-of-Fit Index (AGFI) at 0.959, signify that the model explains a substantial proportion of variance, as both exceed the stan - dard threshold of 0.9. Further, the Normed Fit Index (NFI) of 0.966, the Incremental Fit Index (IFI) of 0.980, and The Tucker-Lewis Index (TLI) of 0.974 provide evidence of strong comparative fit, as values near 1 are ideal. The Parsimony Goodness-of-Fit Index (PGFI) of 0.689 and the Parsimony Normed Fit Index (PNFI) of 0.754, exceeding the acceptable threshold of 0.6), highlight the model ’ s balance between simplicity and explanatory power. The Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA) is 0.033, with a 90% confidence interval ranging from 0.031 (LO 90) to 0.039 (HI 90), indicating minimal approximation error, as values below 0.05 represent an excellent fit. The Comparative Fit Index (CFI) of 0.980, nearly reaching the ideal value of 1, further confirms exceptional overall fit. Collectively, these indices demonstrate that the model is well-constructed, statistically sound, and highly effective in capturing the key dimensions of the data ( Jannoo et al., 2014 ). Moreover, we examined the relationships between variables in the strategic attributes model. Both correlations were statistically signifi - cant, which can be seen in Table 3. Given the obtained results, it can be concluded that hypothesis H1: Strategic coopetition attributes positively impact coopetition performance, may be partially supported. While paradoxicality positively impacts coopetition performance, dynamics exhibit statistically significant but very slightly negative effect. Fig. 1. Conceptual model.

Relational attributes For relational attributes ( asymmetry, complexity, coopetition intensity, mutual dependence, strength, and tensions ), all Cronbach ’ s alpha values range between 0.7 and 0.95, confirming the reliability of the developed measures. Six standardized factor loadings (q0013_0001, q0013_0002, q0013_0003, q0013_0004, q0013_0006 and q0016_0004 – all related to coopetition intensity) were below 0.5, leading to their removal from the model. While all CR values were above 0.7, the AVE values were below 0.5. Despite this, the convergent validity of for tensions, asymmetry, complexity and strength was still deemed adequate, as their AVEs were at least 0,40 and CRs were higher than 0,60. However, coopetition in - tensity and mutual dependence did not meet the convergent validity criterion. Discriminant validity was confirmed for asymmetry, strength, and tensions, as their squared correlations were less than their respec - tive AVEs. Only these three variables confirmed both reliability and validity of the developed measures, as shown in Table 4. The inability to meet the criteria for convergent validity suggests that the observed items for coopetition intensity and mutual dependence exhibit insufficient shared variance with their respective constructs. This issue may stem from inadequately defined items, measurement errors, or the inherent complexity of operationalizing these constructs. The exclusion of certain items and the failure of these two attributes to fulfill validity re - quirements could constrain the generalizability of findings associated with coopetition intensity and mutual dependence. Nonetheless, the confirmed reliability and validity of the attributes asymmetry, strength, and tensions offer a robust basis for the interpretation of the structural of relational attributes, which is presented in Fig. 3. The results of the assessment confirm a very good model fit [CMIN/ DF = 2.111 and p < 0.001, GFI = 0.964, AGFI = 0.953, NFI = 0.956, IFI = 0.977, TLI = 0.972, PGFI = 0.752, PNFI = 0.804. RMSEA = 0.030, LO 90 = 0.027, HI 90 = 0.034, CFI = 0.976]. Finally, we examined the relationships between reliable and valid relational attributes and coo - petition performance. All correlations were statistically significant (see Table 5 ). Given the obtained results, H2: Relational coopetition attributes positively impact coopetition performance, should be rejected as only strength had a positive and significant impact on coopetition perfor - mance. In contrast, asymmetry and tensions (reverse coded) indicated significant but negative impacts, assuming that we consider a set of these three as relational attributes of coopetition. 4.3. Behavioral attributes For behavioral attributes, a formerly developed and multidimen - sionally validated measurement model was used. At the stage of vali - dating the measurement model, all Cronbach ’ s alpha values exceeded 0.7 and were below 0.95, all standardized factor loadings were above 0.5, AVE levels were higher 0.5, and all CRs were above 0.7 ( Klimas et al., 2025 ). Using this valid measurement model for behavioral attri - butes, we examined the relationships between these attributes and coopetition performance. The structural model is shown in Fig. 4. The results of the evaluation indicate a very good model fit [CMIN/DF = 2.139 and p < 0.001, GFI = 0.947, AGFI = 0.938, NFI = 0.949, IFI = 0.972, TLI = 0.969, PGFI = 0.802, PNFI = 0.850. RMSEA = 0.031, LO 90 = 0.028, HI 90 = 0.033, CFI = 0.972]. The detailed results, depicted in Table 6, reveal that all the Fig. 2. Structural model of strategic attributes (standardized estimates).

{"page_content": "behavioral attributes positively impact coopetition performance, except for conflict (reverse coded), where the effect was not statistically sig - nificant. This leads us to conclude that our third hypothesis – H3: Behavioral coopetition attributes positively impact coopetition performance - is partially supported. 5. Discussion In line with the role of coopetition attributes in influencing coope - tition performance, as identified in the literature ( Bengtsson & Raza-Ullah, 2016; Dorn et al., 2016; Klimas et al., 2023; Raza-Ullah, 2021; Tidstr ¨om & Åhman, 2006 ), this study tests the assumed positive impact of these attributes. The results generally confirm the statistical significance of these attributes, though the direction of their influence is not uniformly positive across all strategic, relational, or behavioral attributes. Regarding the attributes characterizing coopetition strategies, both paradoxicality and dynamism were found to significantly impact coo - petition performance, with paradoxicality exhibiting a greater positive effect. This confirms the general assumption that coopetition strategies create value-generating opportunities ( Bouncken et al., 2015; Chiam - baretto, Maurice, & Willinger, 2020; Garri, 2021; Peng et al., 2018; Rai et al., 2023 ). However, the slightly negative impact of dynamism on coopetition performance is also justifiable. High variability in coopeti - tion strategies, actions, and tasks may cause delays and hinder goal attainment ( Bengtsson & Raza-Ullah, 2016; Bouncken et al., 2018; Bouncken & Kraus, 2013; Raza-Ullah, 2020 ). Nonetheless, given that coopetition is a favored strategy for dynamic and fast-growing in - dustries, some degree of dynamism is necessary ( Crick & Crick, 2019; Gernsheimer, Kanbach, et al., 2024; Telg, Lokshin, & Letterie, 2023 ), which can explain why the negative impact is minimal. The results for relational attributes indicate that strong relationships, including a low propensity to change coopetitors, and good relationships – both formal and informal – lead to greater coopetition performance. This confirms previous findings regarding the importance of relational strength ( Corbo et al., 2023; Dorn et al., 2016; Park, Srivastava, & Gnyawali, 2014 ). Conversely, asymmetry in resources, size, power im - balances, and high levels of tension, including issues related to sharing versus protecting knowledge and co-creation versus appropriation of value, decrease coopetition performance. These findings align with previous research indicating that while both asymmetry ( Jakobsen, 2020; Kwon et al., 2020; Le Roy & Czakon, 2016; Lechner et al., 2016; Monticelli et al., 2018; Osarenkhoe, 2010 ) and tensions ( Bouncken et al., 2018; Gernsheimer, Kanbach, et al., 2024; Jakobsen, 2020; Liu et al., 2021; Rai et al., 2023 ) are necessary to some extent, they should be closely monitored, as excessive levels are harmful, even destructive ( Dorn et al., 2016; Meena et al., 2023 ) for coopetition relationships. Thus, as also prior research consistently suggests, excessive tension re - duces coopetition performance but also hints at the potential for mod - erate tension to foster positive outcomes by stimulating innovation and problem-solving ( Czakon et al., 2020; Munten et al., 2021 ). However, determining an optimal level of tension is challenging, as it depends on various contextual factors, such as industry characteristics, the nature of Fig. 3.

Measure - ment complexities arise due to these variations, making it difficult to define a one-size-fits-all metric for optimal tension. Behavioral attributes, including competition intensity, formality, mutual investments, and trust, have all been identified as positively influencing coopetition performance. These results support earlier research indicating that intensity of competition (including, for example, overlapping markets, competencies, target customers, but also the importance of competition in terms of firm performance ( Chen et al., 2019; Dorn et al., 2016 )), formality (including precise specification of terms and operational actions within coopetition, significant legal con - straints ( Amata et al., 2022 )), mutual investments (effort and time in mutual adjustments, learning from each other in terms of applied stra - tegies, systems, implemented processes, internal procedures ( Estrada & Dong, 2020; Klimas et al., 2023; Zhang, Li, Xue, Yang, & Li, 2024 )), as well as trust (both at the organizational and interpersonal levels) ( Bengtsson & Raza-Ullah, 2016; Czakon & Czernek, 2016; Lascaux, 2020; Monticelli et al., 2018 )) stimulate coopetition performance. Interestingly, our findings regarding the behavioral attribute conflict show that its absence does not significantly impact coopetition perfor - mance as it only shows a slightly positive effect (0.029), suggesting that low levels of conflict do not harm coopetition performance. This aligns with previous research ( Chai, Li, Tangpong, & Clauss, 2020; Leonidou et al., 2002; Rajala & Tidstr ¨om, 2021 ), while also reflecting the real-world applications, where eliminating conflict entirely is unrealistic given that the competitive nature of the parties involved. However, our results indicate that this should not be a significant concern. 6. Conclusion The concept of coopetition, characterized by the simultaneous collaboration and competition between organizations for mutually beneficial outcomes ( Bengtsson & Kock, 2000 ), is crucial in shaping business performance ( Bouncken & Fredrich, 2012; Crick, 2019; Estrada & Dong, 2020; Lechner et al., 2016; Mwesiumo et al., 2023; Ricciardi et al., 2022 ), particularly in times of rapid technological advancements ( Bouncken et al., 2018; Quintana-Garcia & Benavides-Velasco, 2004; Veiga et al., 2024 ). This study addresses a research gap in the literature by quantitatively analyzing the impact of coopetition attributes on coopetition performance ( Klimas et al., 2023; Raza-Ullah & Kostis, 2020 ) – a research area predominantly explored through qualitative research ( Czakon & Czernek, 2016; Gernsheimer et al., 2021 ). By quantitatively examining strategic, relational, and behavioral coopeti - tion attributes using data from 1216 manufacturing firms in Poland and applying a Covariance-Based Structural Equation Model (CB-SEM), our research provides significant insights for businesses operating in sectors where innovation and competitive dynamics intersect with economic and social forces. The results reveal that specific attributes significantly influence coopetition performance in a positive way, e.g., the strategic attribute of paradoxicality, the relational attribute of strength, and several behavioral attributes - trust, competition intensity, investments, and for - mality. Conversely, the strategic attribute of dynamics was found to Fig. 4. Structural model of behavioral attributes (standardized estimates).

Theoretical contributions This study provides theoretical and empirical contributions to the field of coopetition research by addressing critical gaps in the literature and advancing the understanding of how coopetition attributes influ - ence performance. While coopetition has emerged as a crucial strategy for driving innovation and achieving sustainable competitive advan - tages ( Amata et al., 2022; Crick & Crick, 2021a; Czakon et al., 2014; Garri, 2021; Mwesiumo et al., 2023; Veiga et al., 2024 ), existing research largely emphasizes either its positive impacts ( Amata et al., 2022; Chen et al., 2019; Christ et al., 2017; Pellegrin-Boucher et al., 2013 ) or the inherent tensions that can paradoxically lead to strategic failure ( Bengtsson & Raza-Ullah, 2016; Bouncken et al., 2018; Raza-Ullah, 2020 ). Moreover, the field remains dominated by concep - tual and qualitative studies ( Garri, 2021 ), leaving a substantial gap in large-scale quantitative research to empirically explore the mechanisms linking coopetition to performance ( Akpinar & Vincze, 2016; Czakon & Rogalski, 2014; Gernsheimer et al., 2021, 2024b; Klimas, Gadomska-Lila, & Sachpazidu, 2024; Mwesiumo et al., 2023 ). Addressing this gap, our study leverages one of the largest datasets in coopetition research to date to establish a quantitative foundation that builds upon and refines existing qualitative research, advancing the understanding of how specific coopetition attributes drive performance. By empirically testing a comprehensive set of 13 coopetition attributes ( Klimas et al., 2025; Klimas, Sta ´nczyk, & Sachpazidu, 2024 ), which have previously been studied either independently or in smaller combina - tions, this study not only tests the presumed positive impact of these attributes, extending previous research efforts, but also reveals the nuanced and complex ways in which they shape performance, tackling inconsistencies and ambiguities in the field, while reinforcing the theoretical framework of coopetition ( Dorn et al., 2016; Garri, 2021 ). Our findings underscore the statistical significance of these attri - butes, highlighting that although many positively influence perfor - mance, their effects are not uniformly positive across all categories. This nuanced understanding enriches the field by addressing calls for large- sample, quantitative studies ( Akpinar & Vincze, 2016; Crick & Crick, 2019; Czakon & Rogalski, 2014 ) and providing robust insights into the mechanisms linking coopetition to its performance ( Garri, 2021; Mwe - siumo et al., 2023; Ricciardi et al., 2022 ), an area underexplored in previous studies ( Bouncken et al., 2015; Dorn et al., 2016; Garri, 2021; Klimas, Gadomska-Lila, & Sachpazidu, 2024; Rai et al., 2023 ).Thus, by investigating the multidimensional aspects of coopetition performance across strategic, relational and behavioral attributes, we provide in - sights that were either inadequately covered or overlooked in earlier studies. Given the importance of large sample sizes in coopetition studies ( Crick & Crick, 2019 ), our large-scale quantitative approach paves the way for future studies to further explore the inherent complexity of coopetition and its multidimensional attributes, offering a deeper un - derstanding of its strategic, relational, and behavioral dimensions and their varied impacts on performance. 6.2. Managerial implications In addition to its theoretical contributions, this research offers valuable practical insights for managers aiming to optimize coopetition strategies as well as their results. Based on our analysis of coopetition attributes and their impact on performance, several key recommenda - tions emerge. Generally, our research suggest that managers can enhance coopetition performance by focusing on the attributes that positively influence outcomes, while mitigating those having the nega - tive effects, as shown in Tables 3, 5 and 6. To improve the likelihood of success in coopetition, it is essential to focus on several critical dimensions.

Based on our analysis of coopetition attributes and their impact on performance, several key recommenda - tions emerge. Generally, our research suggest that managers can enhance coopetition performance by focusing on the attributes that positively influence outcomes, while mitigating those having the nega - tive effects, as shown in Tables 3, 5 and 6. To improve the likelihood of success in coopetition, it is essential to focus on several critical dimensions. First, managers should foster an understanding of the paradoxical nature of coopetition, emphasizing the need for frameworks that encourage equitable and mitigate the risk of opportunism. Second, the strength of coopetitive relationships is pivotal. This involves cultivating strong attachment to partners and ensuring consistent, effective communication. Trust is equally indispensable, encompassing verbal commitments, transparent actions, reliability, and honesty. Third, fostering a willingness to invest in coopetition is crucial. This entails mutual dedication to learning from each other, allocating time, and committing resources. While recognizing the competitive dynamics inherent in coopetition, it is important for managers to acknowledge competitive behaviors to - wards partners while simultaneously striving for shared goals. Formal - ization of actions is another vital element, with written agreements ensuring clarity and accountability. However, agreements should also allow for flexibility and adaptability to accommodate the dynamic na - ture of coopetitive relationships. On the other hand, proactive efforts should be made to mitigate specific challenges. Addressing asymmetry between partners, whether in terms of power dynamics and resource investments, can strengthen cooperation. Furthermore, managing ten - sions is essential, requiring active resolution of managerial and infor - mational conflicts that arise during coopetition. Strategically addressing these attributes enables managers to navi - gate the complexities of coopetition and optimize its performance. This research diverges from previous qualitative approaches by offering data- driven insights, specifically tailored for decision-makers operating at the intersection of technological change and social dynamics. The findings provide actionable guidance on strengthening coopetition attributes to enhance performance, while effectively managing challenges posed by excessive dynamism in coopetition strategies. To maximize coopetition performance, managers should prioritize attributes based on their varying impacts on success. Therefore, when enhancing these attributes, it is important to remember that their order in terms of stimulating coopetition success, ranked by their strength of impact, is as follows: paradoxicality, strength, trust, investments, competition intensity, for - mality, and dynamics (noting that this attribute was reverse-coded, meaning the negative effect observed reflects the detrimental impact of a lack of dynamism). Simultaneously, the leveraging effect on coo - petition success can be achieved by limiting the level of both asymmetry and tensions, which have been found to be equally relevant in terms of their negative impact. 6.3. Limitations In our study, we identified three main limitations: one related to the adopted approach to coopetition performance, second concerning the normality of the raw data, and third related to the chosen empirical context. First, we have considered coopetition performance as a coo - petition success, following previous research ( Raza-Ullah, 2021; Raza-Ullah & Kostis, 2020 ) and recent recommendations ( Klimas, Gadomska-Lila, & Sachpazidu, 2024 ). However, this is not the only viable approach. Future research could replicate our study using a temporal perspective on coopetition performance, potentially applying measurement scales such as those proposed by Riccardi et al. ( Ricciardi et al., 2022 ), which might offer additional insights into the dynamic capture of coopetition outcomes over time. Second, preliminary tests, including the Kolmogorow-Smirnow and Shapiro-Wilk tests, indicated that our data did not follow a normal distribution. This poses potential challenges when using CB-SEM for hypothesis testing, as non-normal data can lead to inaccurate confidence intervals, inflated model test statistics, and underestimated standard errors. However, our data ’ s kurtosis and skewness parameters for our raw data suggest a distribution close to normal. Furthermore, our large sample size (N = 1216) helps mitigate these concerns, as the \" rule of 10 \" (N/number of estimated parameters), which ensures sufficient accuracy P. Klimas et al.

Additionally, we excluded 14 outliers from the final analysis, which is critical as they can disproportionately affect the data and analysis results when the raw data does not follow a normal distribution. Furthermore, as noted by Ainur et al. ( Ainur, Sayang, Jannoo, & Yap, 2017 ), the goodness-of-fit measures are \"q uite robust when data are not normal \" (p. 575). However, although SEM does not directly require normality of data, non-normal distributions can be prone to some limitations ( Hair et al., 2019; Jannoo, Yap, Auchoybur, & Lazim, 2014 ). Third, our study, and thus the results obtained, are constrained by the specific national and industrial contexts under investigation. While the relatively large sample size provides valuable insights and may contribute to broader conclusions, it does not suffice as a foundation for universal generalization. On the one hand, coopetition is acknowledged as a context-sensitive phenomenon ( Dorn et al., 2016; Meena et al., 2023 ), which justifies these contextual limitations. On the other hand, to derive more generalizable conclusions regarding the significance of coopetition attributes for performance, research replication across diverse industries and national contexts is needed. In conclusion, it is crucial to recognize these limitations, particularly regarding data distribution and the need for further refinement in measurement methods for specific attributes. Future research should address these limitations to deepen our understanding of the coopetition phenomenon. 6.4. Future research directions To leverage reliability and generalizability of our findings, future research should validate our models across diverse empirical contexts. Given that coopetition is highly contextual ( Czakon et al., 2014; Meena et al., 2023 ), replicating this study in different countries and industries would be valuable, as our study was geographically and sectorally limited. Broadening the scope could provide a deeper understanding of how coopetition attributes influence performance across varied environments. During the analysis of relational attributes, we found that three key attributes - complexity, coopetition intensity, and mutual dependence - did not meet the requirements for discriminant validity. Since these attributes are recognized in the literature as critical for coopetition performance (complexity ( Crick & Crick, 2021a; Geurts et al., 2022 ), coopetition intensity ( Lechner et al., 2016; Mariani & Belitski, 2023; Telg et al., 2023 ), mutual dependence ( Jakobsen, 2020; Randolph, Fang, Memili, Ramadani, & Nayır, 2023 ), future research should develop more robust measurement methods for these attributes to better capture their impact on performance. Further research directions regarding the attributes of dynamics, tension, and conflict can be identified. The slightly negative effect of dynamism on coopetition performance observed in our study is reasonable, as high variability in strategies, actions, and tasks can lead to delays and hinder goal attainment ( Bengtsson & Raza-Ullah, 2016; Bouncken et al., 2018; Raza-Ullah, 2020; Ritala & Hurmelinna-Laukkanen, 2009 ). However, since coopetition is often favored in dynamic, fast-growing industries, some degree of dynamism is necessary ( Chai et al., 2020; Crick & Crick, 2019; Gernsheimer, Kanbach, et al., 2024 ), which explains why the negative effect is mini - mal. It would be interesting for future studies to explore how to balance dynamism and stability, potentially investigating what levels of dyna - mism are most conducive to maximizing performance in different contexts. While excessive tension has been shown to reduce coopetition per - formance, moderate levels of tension may stimulate innovation and problem-solving ( Gast et al., 2015; Kwon et al., 2020; Luo, 2004 ). Determining an optimal level of tension remains challenging, as it de - pends on various contextual factors such as industry characteristics and partnership dynamics. Future research could focus on developing methodologies to measure and better understand the ideal tension levels that foster performance without becoming detrimental. Our results regarding conflict indicate that low levels of conflict do not negatively affect coopetition performance, with the absence of conflict showing only a slightly positive effect (0.029). This aligns with previous studies ( Chai et al., 2020; Kam & Lai, 2018; Kraus et al., 2017 ). While the data does not suggest that conflict significantly enhances performance, the findings imply that maintaining a low level of conflict is not harmful,", "metadata": {"producer": "Acrobat Distiller 8.1.0 (Windows)", "creator": "Elsevier", "creationdate": "2025-04-26T10:33:58+00:00", "crossmarkdomains[1]": "elsevier.com", "crossmarkmajorversiondate": "2010-04-23", "creationdate--text": "26th April 2025", "elsevierwebpdfspecifications": "7.0.1", "robots": "noindex", "moddate": "2025-04-26T10:50:31+00:00", "author": "Patrycja Klimas", "doi": "10.1016/j.techsoc.2025.102819", "title": "Decoding coopetition performance using impactful coopetition attributes: Evidence from manufacturing companies", "keywords": "Coopetition,Coopetition success,Coopetition performance,Coopetition attributes,CB-SEM,Large-scale survey,Manufacturing companies", "subject": "Technology in Society, 81 (2025) 102819. doi:10.1016/j.techsoc.2025.102819", "crossmarkdomains[2]": "sciencedirect.com", "crossmarkdomainexclusive": "true", "source": "data\\Decoding-coopetition-performance-using-impactful-coopetitio_2025_Technology-.pdf", "total_pages": 15, "page": 10, "page_label": "11", "start_index": 0}}

Future studies could delve deeper into whether controlled conflict can, in fact, drive higher performance, as this relationship has not been widely quantified. In conclusion, future research should address these gaps by refining measurement methods and exploring additional dimensions of coope - tition, including optimal levels of dynamism, tension, and conflict. These efforts will further enrich the understanding of how coopetition attributes influence performance across different contexts.

Concerns about its uncontrolled use and ethical implications prompted a thorough examination of problems and gaps in this domain. This study innovates by positioning Gen-AI as a critical solution for improving energy efficiency amidst rising demand for sustainable energy at the operation and supply chain management levels. Based on technological determinism, it introduces an Energy Gen-AI Technology Framework (EnGen-AI) that integrates Gen-AI, energy efficiency, Business Ethics (BE), and Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) prin - ciples for implementing Gen-AI to enhance sustainable energy management. The methodology includes a scoping review, a multi-criteria analysis, and a technology framework. The study harmonises BE-CSR with Gen-AI practices, offering essential guidance for management implementing Gen-AI in sustainable energy solutions whilst observing its impacts on ethical and social aspects. 1. Introduction Following the exhaustion of fossil fuel reservoirs, the surge in energy costs, and the constraints imposed by governmental regulations ( Diaz & Ocampo-Martinez, 2019 ), the world is increasingly aware of the importance of organisations seeking energy efficiency in their produc - tion processes ( Fontoura et al., 2023 ), driven by the effect of economic globalisation ( Chen et al., 2019 ) together with the industrial develop - ment of countries, which culminated in significant increases in energy demand and greenhouse gas emissions (X. D. Wu et al., 2019 ). Enhancing energy effectiveness and curbing emissions of environmental pollutants are pivotal methods to mitigate energy issues ( Yan et al., 2019 ). Therefore, energy consumption and climate change are consoli - dating each year, inducing nations to promote and encourage sustain - able development in their territories, causing energy efficiency programs that address eco-friendly issues to increase worldwide ( Safarzadeh & Rasti-Barzoki, 2019 ), provoking organisations to seek technological solutions to achieve these objectives. The disruptive technologies of Industry 4.0 (I4.0) can be separated into Artificial Intelligence (AI), Additive Manufacturing (AM), Augmented Reality (AR), Big-Data Analytics (BDA), Blockchain, Cloud Computing (Cloud), Drones, Internet of Things (IoT), Robotics, Nano - technology, and Simulation ( Akpan et al., 2025; S. Kumar & Mallipeddi, 2022; Letaief et al., 2022; Salah et al., 2019 ), with AI being one of the most disruptive technologies of this century, with great potential to transform many aspects of society ( Fosso Wamba et al., 2021 ), and is directly related to minimising energy consumption ( Laskurain-Iturbe et al., 2021 ). Through continual technological advancements, Genera - tive Artificial Intelligence (Gen-AI) has emerged as a powerful tool across various domains ( Ma & Huo, 2023 ). It leverages algorithms and machine learning to generate innovative solutions or enhance existing processes. ( Shumailov et al., 2024; Sætra, 2023 ). It can certainly be applied to obtain better energy practices.

{"page_content": "powerful disruptive force that has been transforming on a global scale various sectors of society, such as industry, transport, communications, health and finance ( Du & Xie, 2021 ). However, the radical development of Gen-AI has raised questions regarding its moral responsibility, which in the business sphere translates into questions about Business Ethics (BE) and Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) issues ( Hu, 2024; Islam & Greenwood, 2024 ). To mitigate risks, CSR has increasingly been considered a vital competitive strategy for companies ( Godfrey, 2005 ), serving as a differentiation strategy that helps organisations improve company image and customer loyalty (G. Li et al., 2021 ). The rising demand for energy management and the need to reduce carbon emissions place growing pressure on society. While Gen-AI technologies can optimise energy use, they also raise ethical concerns. The governments of several countries worldwide are increasingly con - cerned about the indiscriminate use of these technologies. Data privacy issues have come to the fore, as large-scale Gen-AI systems often rely on large volumes of consumer data, which can lead to misuse. Algorithm biases can also lead to inequalities in energy access, particularly affecting vulnerable populations. To address these challenges, some countries have initiated AI regulations. For example, Spain’s efforts prompted the European Union to establish its first AI regulatory group in 2022. In 2023, the G7 signed an agreement to guide tech companies in AI development, and the US followed with its first executive order to regulate AI. Ethical and environmental concerns, especially in energy management, are now considered crucial research areas, integrating BE and CSR considerations. A key research challenge is to develop a framework for decision- makers to select Gen-AI technologies that minimise negative impacts on decision-making, balancing innovation with ethical considerations. Although existing studies demonstrate an improvement in the use of Gen-AI in energy efficiency, they lack a concentrated focus, necessi - tating a deeper analysis of the effectiveness of Gen-AI in improving energy management ( Arana-Landín et al., 2023 ). Organisations and stakeholders are encouraged to prioritise Gen-AI technologies, recog - nising their fundamental role in achieving significant results and sus - taining competitiveness in the dynamic business landscape, bringing new challenges, especially in CSR, requiring greater attention to issues of BE ( Ahmad et al., 2021; G. Li et al., 2021 ). These problems highlight the need to consider how Gen-AI technologies impact society and how they should be used. The research gap lies in the absence of comprehensive studies exploring the social and ethical implications of using Gen-AI for energy management, especially in contrasting contexts between developed and developing countries. Although technological advancements have shown promise in optimising energy use, existing literature has yet to sufficiently explore how these innovations align with social and ethical principles, especially across diverse socio-economic environments ( Ahmad et al., 2022; Pandiyan et al., 2023 ). This is crucial, as developed countries may have the infrastructure to absorb these technologies more quickly. In contrast, developing countries face challenges related to equity, access, and ethical considerations in their deployment. Current models underperform to address how these technologies impact vulnerable populations or exacerbate existing inequalities. Integrating Gen-AI with BE-CSR frameworks could lead to more responsible energy solutions ( Du & Xie, 2021; Luqman et al., 2024 ). Thus, research is ur - gently needed to bridge the gap between technical innovation and ethical accountability in energy management across different global contexts. Therefore, considering the challenges discussed, the research question (RQ) is formulated as follows: RQ: How can decision-makers in developed and developing countries be supported in evaluating the ethical and social implications of implementing Gen-AI technologies for energy management while miti - gating organisational risks? To answer this RQ, this study proposes a technology framework, Energy Gen-AI Technology Framework (EnGen-AI), to empower decision-makers in developed and developing countries by providing a structured approach to evaluating and selecting Gen-AI technologies for energy management. It will identify technologies with the least ethical and social risks while promoting sustainability and efficiency. By inte - grating BE-CSR considerations, the framework will allow organisations to make informed choices that align with social values and minimise negative impacts, thereby supporting responsible technological adop - tion across diverse socio-economic contexts. Theoretical implications affirm Gen-AI’s role in driving social change, aligning with technological determinism, particularly its ca - pacity to shape energy management systems. This is especially crucial in both developed and developing countries, where the integration of Gen- AI can significantly impact economic efficiency, environmental sus - tainability, and social equity.

The proposed EnGen- AI provides practical implications for organisations aiming to improve sustainable energy management through Gen-AI implementation. Identifying specific Gen-AI technologies and their impacts on BE-CSR principles is a valuable tool for decision-makers to align technological choices with ethical and social objectives. The managerial insights include four key areas: environmental, so - cial, economic, and political. It enhances energy efficiency, reduces CO2 emissions, fosters inclusive Gen-AI technologies aligned with BE-CSR principles, boosts profits through demand forecasting, and shapes reg - ulations to improve working conditions, all while balancing sustain - ability, ethics, and profitability. Its implementation in developed countries provides opportunities for refining energy efficiency, while in developing countries, it can address equitable access to resources and help avoid widening social gaps. Adopting the EnGen-AI framework fosters sustainable and ethical energy management across diverse socio- economic landscapes by navigating these distinct contexts. The study was organised as follows: This section contextualises and presents the research problems and gap, purpose and motivation, and theoretical and practical implications for this research. Section 2 in - troduces the theoretical settings that form the basis of the study. Section 3 presents the research design, explaining in detail the methodology adopted, which was divided into four stages, the first referring to the scoping review, the second to the questionnaire design and expert panel, the third to Fuzzy DEMATEL (FDEM), and the fourth, the technology framework. Section 4 presents the research results, separated into theoretical and empirical results, and the new EnGen-AI. Section 5 presents the findings’ discussions. Section 6 summarises the research and offers some conclusions and contributions. 2. Theoretical settings Theoretical settings for the EnGen-AI framework are rooted in technological determinism, which posits that technology drives societal change and influences social structures. The proposed framework helps decision-makers evaluate and select optimal Gen-AI technologies for energy management while considering BE-CSR impacts. The theoretical foundation supports the idea that technological advancements in energy management, such as Gen-AI, can bring about substantial shifts in operational efficiency, sustainability, and governance. However, these technologies’ unintended consequences could exacerbate energy chal - lenges without a structured approach. This application of technological determinism reinforces the idea that Gen-AI can be a transformative force in energy management, driving both innovation and responsible decision-making. 2.1. Technological determinism theory In 1964, Marshall McLuhan introduced technological determinism, a theory that examines how technological factors influence human thought and behaviour, questioning their control over human affairs ( Dafoe, 2015; de la Cruz Paragas & Lin, 2016 ).

However, adverse effects are primarily attributed to human misuse rather than inherent flaws in the technology itself, being recog - nised as a reductionist approach that overstates the influence of tech - nology on society and understates social influences on the development of technology ( Baek & Lee, 2021 ). Technological determinism can lead to significant analytical problems in work and employment research, asserting a straightforward connection between technology and society, suggesting that technological evolution is linear and independent, influencing society without human intervention ( Joyce et al., 2023 ). One of the main criticisms of technological determinism is that the model assumes technology can operate autonomously, failing to recog - nise that humans still possess the ability to control technological development ( Leonardi & Barley, 2010 ). This creates a dilemma where technology dictates societal conditions without human intervention ( ˇ Sabanovi ´c, 2010 ). Another critique of technological determinism is that it may overlook the significance of social, political, and cultural forces during technological evolution, which can directly influence techno - logical applications. Therefore, presuming that technological impacts on society are always predictable and linear is problematic, as introducing new technologies may lead to unintended consequences, including digital inequality and environmental degradation ( Dafoe, 2015 ). Technological Determinism has two versions: a soft view, which maintains that technological change drives social change but at the same time responds in a discriminatory way to social pressures, and a complex view, which perceives technological development as an autonomous force, utterly independent of social restrictions, that is, the relationship between technology and society; the analysis attribute that can be extracted from technological determinism is that it is a technology that affects and society that is affected ( Baek & Lee, 2021 ). In this way, the present study uses technological determinism to investigate the impact of Gen-AI-related technologies on BE-CSR principles. 2.2. Gen-AI-related technologies Data has emerged as a new valuable asset, wherein obtaining perti - nent data remains a hurdle for decision-making, impacting the efficacy of AI algorithms ( Patel et al., 2024 ). Modern AI technologies are widely employed for automating processes and enhancing learning within the digital service provisions of cloud computing giants like Google, Face - book, and Amazon ( Casta ˜n ´e et al., 2023 ). AI aims to create intelligent entities capable of learning and performing tasks that usually require human intelligence on devices or computerised systems with the ability to acquire knowledge for executing tasks ( Fosso Wamba et al., 2021 ). AI has developed rapidly due to the need for technologies capable of interpreting large amounts of data and learning and adapting as needed ( Kaplan & Haenlein, 2019 ). AI methodologies have two main classifi - cations: (i) reasoning and decision-making and (ii) learning. The first set focuses on decision-making, searching for solutions, and optimising processes, while the second set concerns learning, communication, and perception ( Colchester et al., 2017 ). The swift advancement of AI-related technologies is evident in in - novations like ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, and DALL-E, exemplifying progress in Gen-AI technologies ( Jackson, Jesus Saenz, & Ivanov, 2024 ). Recently, Gen-AI has become a representative technological advance - ment in deep learning research, as classical methods present difficulties in data learning and design efficiency, opening new possibilities in different areas of society ( Liao et al., 2024 ). Therefore, Gen-AI models seek to comprehend and replicate the inherent patterns within a dataset, facilitating the creation of new content that closely mirrors the original data distribution ( Jackson, Ivanov, et al., 2024 ). Presently, forecasts suggest that Gen-AI will contribute trillions of dollars in annual value to the worldwide economy ( Fosso Wamba et al., 2023 ), with the global market for Gen-AI technologies and services projected to attract in - vestment amounting to billions of dollars in the coming years. Generative learning is an intelligent design method dominated by Gen-AI, which has powerful design data learning and new efficient design generation capabilities and has been continuously developing and advancing in recent years with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) ( Chougale et al., 2022 ), Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) ( Tan et al., 2022 ), and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) ( Ba-Alawi et al., 2022 ) being the most utilised techniques ( Liao et al., 2024 ). Other Gen-AI-related technologies are also highlighted, such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) ( Cabello-L ´opez et al.,", "metadata": {"producer": "Acrobat Distiller 8.1.0 (Windows)", "creator": "Elsevier", "creationdate": "2025-05-09T06:16:23+00:00", "crossmarkdomains[1]": "elsevier.com", "crossmarkmajorversiondate": "2010-04-23", "creationdate--text": "9th May 2025", "elsevierwebpdfspecifications": "7.0.1", "robots": "noindex", "moddate": "2025-05-09T08:16:17+00:00", "author": "Leonardo Fontoura", "doi": "10.1016/j.techsoc.2025.102847", "title": "Energy Gen-AI technology framework: A perspective of energy efficiency and business ethics in operation management", "keywords": "Generative artificial intelligence,Energy efficiency,Industry 4.0,Corporate social responsibility,Business ethics,Fuzzy DEMATEL", "subject": "Technology in Society, 81 (2025) 102847. doi:10.1016/j.techsoc.2025.102847", "crossmarkdomains[2]": "sciencedirect.com", "crossmarkdomainexclusive": "true", "source": "data\\Energy-Gen-AI-technology-framework--A-perspective-of-energy-_2025_Technology.pdf", "total_pages": 19, "page": 2, "page_label": "3", "start_index": 0}}

Other Gen-AI-related technologies are also highlighted, such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) ( Cabello-L ´opez et al., 2023 ), Transformers or Generative Language Models (GLMs) ( Saheb et al., 2022 ), Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) ( Prabha et al., 2023 ), and diffusion models. Table 1 displays, with the support of the scoping review, six Gen-AI-related technologies applied to promote better energy practices, maintaining concerns inherent to the principles of BE-CSR in their practices. 2.3. BE-CSR principles With the increasing use of technologies based on Gen-AI in everyday life, more developments appear promising for use in areas related to operation management, especially for energy management, but simul - taneously, there are growing concerns inherent to their use in ethical and social responsibility issues ( Tseng & Lin, 2024 ). However, the great challenge is understanding how these issues affect operational man - agement and how they are linked to society ’ s well-being ( Saheb et al., 2022 ). To better understand these impacts, the research categorised the principles related to BE-CSR based on the literature as follows: (i) integrity, (ii) transparency and accountability, (iii) fairness and bias mitigation, (iv) privacy and data protection, (v) compliance with laws and regulations, (vi) sustainability and environmental responsibility, and (vii) employment and workforce. Integrity is paramount in addressing ethical issues. This ensures that Gen-AI technologies are developed, distributed, and utilised according to moral and ethical standards, aligning with human values to reach justifiable conclusions and embody machine ethics ’ essence ( Han et al., 2023 ). Transparency and accountability are essential for upholding human values and privacy in companies. In addition to preventing bias or inaccurate conclusions, this principle promotes accurate assessment for management decision-making ( Dansana et al., 2023 ). Fairness and bias mitigation are vital to avoid biased data in training Gen-AI models, which can lead to discriminatory behaviour and unfair outcomes (C. H. Liu et al., 2021 ). Privacy and data protection were trending as essential themes to safeguard user privacy, which is constantly developing in Gen-AI to avoid forbidden access to personal and sensitive information ( Asha et al., 2023 ). Compliance with laws and regulations is critically important, and organisations that adhere to its use can guarantee the protection of human values and minimise adverse consequences, building public trust that Gen-AI is safe and ensuring their rights and interests are protected (W. Liu et al., 2023 ). Sustainability and environmental responsibility significantly impact social and environmental issues when using Gen-AI models to identify sustainable product features, which can mitigate energy use and carbon emissions ( Cabello-L ´opez et al., 2023 ). The advance of Gen-AI technologies can affect employment and the work - force, raising concerns about job displacement and the need to adapt to changes in the workforce, which impacts ethical and social principles in society (R. Kumar et al., 2021 ). 3. Research design The epistemological foundation of this research is post-positivist with mixed methods, which entails the pursuit of an objective under - standing of reality while acknowledging the inherent limitations of human knowledge and the uncertainty associated with the phenomena under investigation ( Aghimien et al., 2022; Baskerville & Wood-Harper, 1996 ). The scoping review aligns with a post-positivist epistemology by L. Fontoura et al.

{"page_content": "systematically mapping and synthesising existing knowledge ( Fontoura et al., 2023; Nascimento et al., 2022 ). The scoping review was chosen to gather Gen-AI technologies for energy management and BE-CSR prin - ciples because it enables a broad mapping of the research field, identifies gaps in existing literature, and establishes potential criteria analysis ( Levac et al., 2010 ). This proposed framework endorses applying quantitative methods, including Likert-scale questionnaires ( Garcia-Buendia et al., 2022 ), to identify participants ’ demographic information and collect data on the interrelationships between identified Gen-AI technologies and BE-CSR principles and FDEM, which aim to objectively structure complex is - sues while acknowledging potential biases and uncertainties in data interpretation ( Swarnakar et al., 2022 ).

{"page_content": "on BE-CSR principles. The main advantages of using FDEM are over - coming the inevitable uncertainty, reducing the number of searches, and enabling the semantic structure of the prediction items to be explained, along with the individual attributes of the expert ( Fontoura et al., 2023 ). Additionally, the framework grounded in technological determinism underscores the notion that technology profoundly influences social structures ( Salehan et al., 2018 ). Building upon this foundation, we propose a novel technology framework that integrates Gen-AI technol - ogies to enhance energy efficiency while concurrently aligning with BE-CSR principles. This framework differentiates between developed and developing countries, acknowledging their distinct technological capacities, regulatory landscapes, and socio-economic contexts to ensure a more tailored and effective implementation. This epistemo - logical stance validates the selection of methods, blending quantitative approaches with solid theoretical foundations to offer a comprehensive yet adaptable understanding of the phenomena under investigation. The research design was separated into four stages, as shown in Fig. 1. 3.1. Scoping review The scoping review was selected to combine Gen-AI technologies for energy management and BE-CSR principles due to its ability to comprehensively map critical concepts across a broad research pano - rama. This approach facilitates the identification of gaps in the litera - ture, aiming to systematically determine which criteria best represent the nature of the research ( Levac et al., 2010 ). Moreover, scoping re - views enable the inclusion of various study designs, which is crucial when tackling complex interdisciplinary subjects such as energy man - agement, Gen-AI, and BE-CSR. The iterative nature of the scoping review process allows researchers to refine the scope and adjust the review as new evidence emerges, ensuring a thorough analysis of these emerging fields ( Nascimento et al., 2022 ). The scoping review facilitates a comprehensive mapping of the literature, enabling a broad and practical evaluation while summarising diverse and heterogeneous themes ( Di Pasquale et al., 2020 ). In this study, the scoping review was separated into six stages: (i) identify the research questions, (ii) identify relevant studies, (iii) study selection, (iv) chart the data, (v) validation and data coding, and (vi) collating, summarising, and reporting ( Danese et al., 2018; Fontoura et al., 2023 ). Recently, the scoping review methodology has been applied across various fields relevant to this study, such as AI technologies ( De Wilde et al., 2025 ), energy efficiency ( Maani et al., 2021 ), and ethical and social principles ( Chu et al., 2023 ), among others. For transparency, the scoping review was conducted considering a rigorous interdisciplinary discussion between authors to activate the research questions, which focused on Gen-AI, energy efficiency, and BE- CSR principles. A reasonable review provided the theoretical basis and identified research gaps; in this way, to identify relevant studies, the search string was built using the word tree technique, containing rele - vant keywords found in the literature on the topic studied, improving the quality of research ( Saieg et al., 2018 ). This technique helped find precisely what authors were looking for in the literature, reducing the number of documents in the initial collection, as shown in Fig. 2. The compilation was assembled utilising literature from the Scopus and Web of Science (WoS) databases, configured to execute the search by title, abstract, and keywords. The process of selecting studies was detailed to establish and implement criteria for inclusion and exclusion, as shown in Table 2, discarding any study that does not fit the established criteria. This objective is achieved through criteria that allow the inclusion of studies in the review (inclusion criteria) and those that should be discarded in a thorough reading (exclusion criteria) ( Nú ˜nez-Merino et al., 2020 ). The inclusion and exclusion criteria must be implemented objectively, explicitly and consistently, providing clarity in the selection ( Saieg et al., 2018 ). Only peer-reviewed papers from journals and conference pro - ceedings were used, as they are more reliable documents for carrying out a literature review ( Fontoura et al., 2023; Nascimento et al., 2022 ). The collection contains 209 documents, resulting in a final portfolio with 79 documents after applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria, as shown in Fig. 3 and outlined in the supplementary documentation ( https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/wrjgynvthf ). The documents were analysed in two stages: reading the titles, abstracts, and keywords, followed by the second stage, where the full reading was accomplished.

In addition, BE-CSR principles were identified in the scenario of using Gen-AI practices. The validation and data code stage enabled the comparison of all data between the authors, allowing dis - cussions to solve possible differences, guaranteeing reliability, and eliminating bias of the evaluators ( Danese et al., 2018 ). The last stage is Collating, summarising, and reporting, in which all the scoping review results are grouped into a table to support authors in continuing their research. 3.2. Questionnaire design and expert panel The questionnaire design and the expert panel selection for data collection in the FDEM study followed a structured approach to ensure rigour and reliability, guided by the principles outlined by Okoli and Pawlowski (2004). The objective was to verify, through a Likert scale, the impact of Gen-AI technologies used for energy management on BE-CSR principles, derived from a comprehensive scoping review. The selection of experts followed the criteria outlined by Fontoura et al. (2023), which required the inclusion of academics and practitioners actively engaged in research and professional activities relevant to the subject matter. Experts were required to meet three critical criteria: (i) extensive knowledge and experience in the area under investigation, with a minimum of five years of relevant professional engagement; (ii) current employment within the focal firm or organisation; and (iii) willingness and availability to actively contribute to the study, as rec - ommended by Bokrantz et al. (2017). To recruit participants, 82 experts were initially contacted and identified through recommendations from higher authorities within the focal firm, with all expressing willingness to participate. These experts occupied roles such as electronic engineers, production engineers, technology analysts, university professors, production and industrial managers, production heads, and directors in manufacturing. After profile reviews, the final panel included 23 experts, yielding a response rate of approximately 28%. The panel consisted of 10 practitioners and 13 academics, all with at least five years of experience in engineering, computing and information technology, business management systems, or finance, as summarised in Table 3. Although there are no rules regarding the minimum number of participants for FDEM ( Moktadir et al., 2020 ), a minimum of 10 participants is recommended to reach a consensus ( Okoli & Pawlowski, 2004 ). The panel ’ s expertise covered a range of specialisations within en - gineering, including software development, electrical and energy pro - jects, digital transformation, data analysis, project management, automation, and I4.0 technologies. Participants from computing and IT had in-depth knowledge of AI, including machine learning, image analysis, and deep learning. At the same time, those in business and management systems contributed expertise in digital technologies, op - erations, logistics, supply chains, and ethical and social audits. The finance experts brought insights into technology management and neural networks. Furthermore, the expert panel was designed to ensure diversity in technical, social, and cultural perspectives, with participants representing developed and developing countries.

{"page_content": "platform ( https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/wrjgynvthf ). The first phase collected demographic information, including participants ’ aca - demic qualifications, professional background, current roles, total years of experience, and country of residence. The second phase aimed to gather data on the perceived impact of Gen-AI technologies on BE-CSR principles, focusing on improving energy efficiency. To ensure the questionnaire ’ s clarity and accuracy, a pre-test was conducted by the authors to identify and correct any potential errors or ambiguities. Before completing the form, all participants were provided with a brief overview of the study ’ s objectives and the topics ’ relevance. Each participant was asked to evaluate the impact of Gen-AI technologies on the identified BE-CSR principles using a 5-point Likert scale. Responses ranged from ’ very low impact ’ (VLI) to ’ very high impact ’ (VHI), reflecting the experts ’ assessment of how these technologies influence ethical and social principles. 3.3. Fuzzy DEMATEL (FDEM) The FDEM method combines fuzzy set theory and the traditional DEMATEL technique to improve expert judgment proficiency ( Fontoura et al., 2023 ), converting cause-effect relationships into an intelligible structural model and identifying the most critical elements that affect other elements ( Garcia-Buendia et al., 2022; Keskin, 2015; D. Kumar et al., 2023 ). The fuzzy set theory introduced the notion of a member - ship function to address issues related to various linguistic variables (B. Chang et al., 2011 ), converting highly uncertain linguistic preferences into quantitative values while maintaining human choices and their qualitative characteristics (P.-T. Chang et al., 2000 ). The defuzzification process reduces a series of conclusions of varying relevance to a single exit point ( Cheung et al., 2005 ). This method is helpful for visualising complex causal relationship structures with matrices and can convert the relationship between the criteria causes and effects into a comprehensible structural model of system (B. Chang et al., 2011 ). The fuzzy membership functions f k ij = ( f k l ij, f k m ij, f k r ij ) are used to generate the total weighted values, assuming that k experts participated in the evaluation process, which f k ij signifies the fuzzy weight of the i th attribute ’ s effect on the j th attribute as assessed by the expert k th ( Fontoura et al., 2023 ). The cause-and-effect groups containing specific attributes represent the structured interrelationships and essential effects. A set of attributes is proposed ( F ), and specific pairwise interrelationships are used to create the mathematical relations ( Tsai et al., 2020 ). FDEM was used in different types and areas of research, such as management, to segment the necessary skills to promote better the development of global managers ’ skills (W.-W. Wu & Lee, 2007 ), busi - ness, to evaluate Lean Supply Chain Management performance ( Garcia-Buendia et al., 2022 ), manufacture, to discover better energy metrics, production and environmental processes ( Fontoura et al., 2023 ), healthcare, evaluating the universal health coverage in emerging seven economies, highlighting economic conditions and population challenges ( Shi et al., 2019 ), financial market, to identify and prioritise the key criteria that influence the performance of wealth management Fig. 2.

Step 1 Normalise the Fuzzy numbers: F k ij = ( f k l ij, f k m ij, f k r ij ) = [ l k ij \u0000 min ( l k ij ) Δ, m k ij \u0000 min ( m k ij ) Δ, r k ij \u0000 min ( r k ij ) Δ ] (1) Δ = max ( r k ij ) \u0000 min ( l k ij, m k ij, r k ij ) (2) Where: l k ij = Left TFN values m k ij = Mean TFN values r k ij = Right TFN values Step 2 Compute right ( rv ) and left ( lv ) normalised values: ( lv k ij, rv k ij ) = [ f k m ij 1 + f k m ij \u0000 f k l ij, f k r ij 1 + f k r ij \u0000 f k m ij ] (3) Where: f k l ij = Minimum normalised Fuzzy number f k m ij = Mean normalised Fuzzy number f k r ij = Maximum normalised Fuzzy number Step 3 Compute the normalised crisp values ( x ): x k ij = [ lv k ij ( 1 \u0000 lv k ij ) + ( rv k ij ) 2 ] ( 1 \u0000 lv k ij + rv k ij ) (4) Where: lv k ij = Left normalised value computed rv k ij = Right normalised value computed Step 4 Integrate the crisp values ( ̃x): ̃x ij = x 1 ij + x 2 ij + … + x k ij K (5) Where. x k ij = Normalised crisp value computed K = Total number of respondents Step 5.

Technology framework A technology framework was developed using technological deter - minism, emphasising that technological changes directly cause changes in social structures, institutions and cultural practices ( Baek & Lee, 2021 ) to improve the decision-making regarding Gen-AI for better en - ergy practices, addressing BE-CSR principles. This technology frame - work was built based on a flowchart using the Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN), which provides a notation system that can be easily grasped by a diverse range of users, including business analysts, technical developers, and business personnel engaged in the imple - mentation and oversight of processes ( Chinosi & Trombetta, 2012 ). EnGen-AI integrates Gen-AI-related technologies, prioritises energy efficiency, and incorporates BE-CSR principles. This convergence forms a novel technology framework geared towards enhancing sustainable energy management. The framework operates on multiple layers, of - fering a comprehensive perspective. This holistic view facilitates a better understanding of these technologies ’ ethical and social implications.

{"page_content": "managerial objectives. Developed to empower managers and stake - holders, the framework aids in selecting Gen-AI technologies tailored to specific challenges. It considers the country ’ s developmental stage, revealing the varying impacts on BE-CSR principles in response to social, cultural, and technological dynamics. 4. Results The following section provides a comprehensive analysis of the study ’ s results, focusing on the impacts of Gen-AI technologies. The findings detail how these technologies influence ethical and socially responsible practices. This analysis informed the creation of the EnGen- AI framework, which outlines critical problem statements related to energy management, identifies the most suitable Gen-AI technologies, and links their impact to BE-CSR principles. The framework is a strategic guide for organisations aiming to enhance their ethical standards and operational efficiency through advanced AI solutions. These results form the foundation for the EnGen-AI framework, underscoring its potential to shape future developments in technology and ethics. 4.1. BE-CSR principles have been addressed using Gen-AI to improve energy efficiency Despite the proliferation of AI technology over the last decade, public perception of its use raises several ethical, legal and social questions, making it necessary to go beyond addressing issues related to algorithms to analyse the translation of legislation and guidelines into practice to ensure BE and CSR principles (Y. Huang et al., 2023 ). In this way, essential questions arise about integrity ( Prabha et al., 2023 ), transparency and accountability ( Dansana et al., 2023 ), fairness and bias mitigation (C. H. Liu et al., 2019 ), privacy and data protection ( Asha et al., 2023 ), compliance with laws and regulations ( Abdelaziz et al., 2023 ), sustainability and environmental responsibility ( Cabello-L ´opez et al., 2023 ), and employment and workforce (R. Kumar et al., 2021 ), which are considered essential principles in using AI. Table 5 shows the Gen-AI-related technologies used to improve energy efficiency and BE-CSR principles discussed in the literature. Among all Gen-AI-related technologies for energy efficiency found in data analysis, which addressed BE-CSR principles, CNNs are highlighted as the most cited technologies to improve energy management, with 45.12% of citations, followed by RNNs with 25.61%. GNNs were the worst cited technologies, with only 1.22%. Regarding BE-CSR princi - ples, sustainability and environmental responsibility stand out as the most cited principle, with 48.86% of citations, followed by integrity, with 18.18%. 4.2. Impacts of Gen-AI-related technologies on BE and CSR principles A study was conducted to determine the Gen-AI-related technologies for energy efficiency that have the most impact on BE-CSR principles. For this, the FDEM technique was applied to evaluate these influences. The analysis was separated into two clusters: developing countries and developed countries. An analysis to shape the initial direct relation matrices I was applied using all responses collected from experts of each cluster, in which the linguistic scales VLI, LI, MI, HI, VHI ( “ very low impact ”, “ low impact ”, “ moderate impact ”, “ high impact ”, and “ very high impact ” ) were used. The next step was to convert the initial direct relation matrix I into a Triangular Fuzzy Number (TFN), using the data in Table 4, replacing each linguistic variable with its corresponding number. The defuzzification process uses Equations (1) and (3). Equa - tion (4) used the resulting crisp values to generate the direct relation matrices D. Equation (5) was used to calculate the average values of the direct relation matrices D, followed by the generalised direct relation matrix G, built with Equation (6). The total direct relation matrix T was acquired using Equations (7) and (8), presented in detail in Table 6.

{"page_content": "technologies to improve energy efficiency on BE-CSR principles, based on expert opinions, in which high values represent a stronger impact. Percentage analysis was used to help and facilitate the interpretation of the results, in which for developing countries and developed countries, the percentiles 80 and 60 were computed as limits, representing strong and moderate impacts on the interrelationship ( Garcia-Buendia et al., 2022 ). In other words, values above 0.1622 (developing countries) and 0.1567 (developed countries) were considered to have a moderate impact (yellow), and values above 0.1688 (developing countries) and 0.1715 (developed countries) were considered to have a strong impact (green). Any impact values below percentile 25 (0.1541 for developing countries and 0.1428 for developed countries) were considered insuffi - cient ( Fontoura et al., 2023 ). 4.3. EnGen-AI for better energy management and BE-CSR through Gen-AI practices EnGen-AI integrates Gen-AI technologies, energy efficiency strate - gies, and BE-CSR principles to develop an innovative approach for improving sustainable energy management through Gen-AI imple - mentation. Built on technological determinism, EnGen-AI highlights how technological advancements drive changes in social structures, institutions, and cultural practices ( Baek & Lee, 2021 ). It can be used as a guideline for implementing Gen-AI-related technologies in favour of energy efficiency. It allows managers and stakeholders a macro view of which technologies would best apply to the desired project, including observing which impacts would be caused on BE-CSR principles and providing better decision-making. As portrayed in Figs. 4 and 5, the context of development level and area of activity, as well as the nature of the Gen-AI problem at hand, introduces contingencies that significantly influence the selection and impact of Gen-AI technologies on BE-CSR principles in energy efficiency. The disparities between developing and developed countries, marked by variations in technological infra - structure, resource availability, and regulatory frameworks, contribute to the need for tailored solutions. To effectively utilise the EnGen-AI framework, the manager or stakeholder must first select the context in which they operate, explicitly determining whether the country is classified as developed or devel - oping. This classification is based on the criteria set by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Following this, the manager should define the problem statement, identifying the or - ganisation ’ s specific energy requirements to inform the scope of the study. Once these foundational steps are completed, EnGen-AI will recommend the most suitable Gen-AI technology to address the identi - fied needs. Subsequently, the BE-CSR principles will be identified and assessed based on their level of impact. A colour-coded scale is applied, where green indicates a strong impact and yellow signifies a moderate impact. In developing countries, as shown in Fig. 4, where challenges such as security vulnerabilities in wireless networks and energy forecasting approaches are prevalent, the emphasis on technologies like GANs re - flects a pragmatic response to specific contextual needs. In developed countries, as shown in Fig. 5, where the challenges are to improve renewable energy generation, RNN can enhance forecasting and energy demand methods. The level of impact on BE-CSR principles varies depending on the technologies applied, with privacy and data protection playing a pivotal role in addressing pressing concerns in developing countries. On the other hand, fairness and bias mitigation are among the main concerns in developed countries. Furthermore, the type of Gen-AI problem and the complexity of the energy efficiency challenge further accentuate the need for diverse Gen- AI tools. For instance, CNNs and RNNs are highlighted for their role in categorising energy consumption levels in buildings and improving the accuracy of renewable energy forecasting.

The contingencies embedded in the energy efficiency landscape thus necessitate a nuanced approach, wherein the selection of Gen-AI tools aligns with the intricacies of the problem, subsequently influencing companies ’ BE-CSR outcomes. Organisations must recognise these contingencies and strategically adopt technologies that align with their operational needs and contribute positively to ethical and social responsibilities, acknowledging the unique challenges presented by their specific contexts. 5. Discussion The intersection of Gen-AI technologies and BE-CSR principles, as discussed in the context of energy efficiency, unveils a nuanced land - scape that can be analysed through technological determinism. Tech - nological determinism, as a theoretical framework, posits that technological innovation plays a pivotal role in steering societal change. In our exploration, we observe how various Gen-AI technologies influ - ence BE-CSR principles, thereby contributing to the broader discourse on technological determinism. The results underscore the significant impact of Gen-AI technologies on BE-CSR principles, both in developing and developed countries. 5.1. Contributions and impacts of Gen-AI on ethical and social principles For instance, GANs and GLMs are identified as critical contributors to privacy and data protection in developing countries. The highlights of these technologies include addressing security vulnerabilities in wireless networks and improving accuracy in medical event analysis. This aligns with the technological determinist notion that technological progress equals social progress, as advancements in AI-driven security protocols directly enhance information systems ’ privacy and data protection. Moreover, the prominence of these technologies also addresses compliance with laws and regulations, resonating with societal concerns about the ethical use of Gen-AI. This alignment fosters public confidence and acceptance of these technologies, influencing organisational behaviour and shaping broader social outcomes. CNNs used for improved energy control have minimal impact on ethical and social aspects, as their primary focus is image processing. Gen-AI technologies ’ strong impact on fairness and bias mitigation in developed countries reinforces the technological determinist perspec - tive. RNNs and VAEs are identified as critical players, aligning with the belief that technology can drive positive changes in governance and organisational practices. Additionally, RNNs can analyse historical en - ergy consumption data and help forecast energy demand, optimising load management in manufacturing processes. VAEs, in turn, can detect faults by analysing real-time energy consumption data, reducing systems downtime. All these benefits promote better sustainability and align with the technological determinist assertion that technological progress is inseparable from societal progress. The discussion also sheds light on the varying degrees of impact among Gen-AI technologies on different BE-CSR principles. For instance, GNNs are recognised for their relatively lower impact, mainly because these technologies are system-centred, highlighting the nuanced aspects of technological determinism. Divergent perspectives exist regarding how technologies influence ethical and social principles, and these perspectives vary based on a country ’ s level of development. Developing countries experience a sig - nificant impact of Gen-AI on matters related to privacy and data pro - tection, while in developed countries, the primary impact is on fairness and bias mitigation. For developing countries, these findings regarding privacy and data protection concerns are consistent with existing studies that underscore apprehensions regarding the ethical use of Gen-AI. In this context, data protection is essential due to the sensitive nature of certain information, and inadequate safeguards can lead to unau - thorised access, data breaches, and potential data theft, underscoring the need for robust security protocols ( Kaissis et al., 2020; Vla ˇci ´c et al., 2021 ). Regarding developed countries, these findings align with society ’ s ongoing anxieties regarding fairness and bias mitigation, which studies caution against the unscrupulous and irresponsible design of Gen-AI technologies, as such practices may perpetuate systemic prejudices and disparities, particularly affecting marginalised groups and poten - tially exacerbating existing biases ( Meyer et al., 2023 ). In the literature, one of the major concerns with using Gen-AI is the potential for bias and fairness issues stemming from the training data, which reflects the values of its creators and users, resulting in inaccuracies in the model ’ s output (Y. Li & Goel, 2025 ). As Gen-AI and related technologies advance and become more pervasive in everyday processes, addressing algo - rithmic bias emerges as a substantial challenge, necessitating the uti - lisation of diverse datasets and ongoing monitoring to safeguard more accurate decisions ( Barredo Arrieta et al., 2020; Ntoutsi et al., 2020 ).

{"page_content": "One of the notable research findings reveals that, despite concerns in the literature and public perception about the potential impact of indiscriminate Gen-AI technologies use on employment and the work - force (M.- Huang & Rust, 2018 ). Experts from developed and developing countries do not regard this issue as among the most significant or pressing. However, it will be a perennial issue requiring close moni - toring by the authorities involved since approximately 47% of jobs in the US will face a significant risk in the forthcoming decades ( Frey & Osborne, 2017 ). Social and economic inequalities often serve as catalysts, amplifying data protection concerns in developing countries where these issues are prevalent. Regarding fairness and bias mitigation, developed countries, with their superior access to advanced technologies, are more concerned about the quality of the data available for training these technologies and how to avoid introducing bias, thus avoiding inaccurate or unfair decision-making. The theory acknowledges that not all technological innovations hold equal influence, and the societal impact is contingent on the nature and design of the technology. Therefore, the findings of the Gen-AI and BE-CSR principles analysis, viewed through technolog - ical determinism, provide valuable insights into the intricate relation - ship between technological advancements and societal progress. The results affirm that Gen-AI technologies are not just tools but active agents shaping ethical considerations and corporate social re - sponsibility, supporting the broader concept that technology is central in influencing and driving social change. 5.2. Theoretical implications The theoretical implications of the study are to promote innovation by integrating Gen-AI with ethical and social responsibility principles for enhanced energy management control ( Thomas et al., 2024 ). This approach offers a technological perspective and a holistic view of BE-CSR issues, enabling researchers and those interested in the topic to understand the opportunities and impacts of the indiscriminate use of Gen-AI ( Wael AL-khatib, 2023 ). Aligning with technological deter - minism, the findings affirm the theory’s assertion that technological progress drives social change ( Sætra, 2023 ). The role of Gen-AI tech - nologies in shaping BE-CSR principles highlights how technological advancements can actively contribute to ethical considerations and so - cietal responsibilities, emphasising the inseparable link between tech - nological innovation and social progress ( Sætra, 2023; Thomas et al., 2024 ). Another theoretical advantage of the EnGen-AI framework is its ca - pacity to differentiate its effects between developed and developing countries by considering the varying levels of technological sophisti - cation, regulatory landscapes, and societal needs in these regions. In developed countries, Gen-AI technologies can enhance energy efficiency by leveraging advanced infrastructure and established ethical frame - works, offering valuable insights into how these innovations can further optimise existing systems. In contrast, these technologies may accelerate technological and societal progress in developing countries, addressing specific challenges such as infrastructural deficiencies or regulatory shortcomings. Consequently, the framework offers a more nuanced un - derstanding of Gen-AI technologies’ ethical and societal impacts in en - ergy management across diverse global contexts, enabling more tailored and context-specific strategies for each environment. The study extends the current understanding by demonstrating that human-centred design and technological determinism converge in acknowledging this dynamic interaction, where technology evolves through user feedback, and society continually adapts to new techno - logical advancements. The theory of technological determinism posits that technology plays a dominant role in shaping societal behaviours and structures ( Carlisle & Manning, 1999; Herrera-Vega, 2015 ). In contrast, the principles of human-centred design advocate for technol - ogy to be tailored to users’ needs and abilities, placing human experi - ence at the core of the design process ( Contreras-Cruz et al., 2023 ). Despite these foundational differences, both paradigms align in certain vital areas. Technological determinism and human-centred design agree that technology aims to enhance the quality of life. Significantly, tech - nology influences society and is shaped by it, indicating a reciprocal relationship between human behaviour and technological innovation. This study also delineates seven unprecedented aspects of ethical and social issues when examined in the context of Gen-AI technologies most utilised to promote energy efficiency. These aspects are integrity, transparency and accountability, fairness and bias mitigation, privacy and data protection, compliance with laws and regulations, sustain - ability and environmental responsibility, and employment and work - force. The Gen-AI technologies were categorised and identified for their optimal use in improving energy management, indicating that the pro - posed framework, EnGen-AI, can serve as a guideline for researchers and those interested in the topic to delve deeper into the impact of these technologies. 5.3.

This inte - gration enabled a robust and multidimensional analysis. The scoping review comprehensively mapped existing literature, identifying gaps and consolidating evidence to form a solid theoretical foundation. From this, a questionnaire was created to capture expert insights, ensuring the collection of relevant data reflecting current trends.

It enables researchers to explore complex and less-studied topics, map knowledge gaps, and understand relationships between critical factors. Addition - ally, it helps bridge theory and practice, turning academic insights into real-world solutions. The flexibility and rigour of this methodology make it suitable across different fields, allowing for more accurate, insightful, and practical outcomes in future studies. 5.4. Practical implications The proposed EnGen-AI offer actionable guidance for organisations seeking to enhance their sustainable energy management practices through Gen-AI implementation. Identifying specific Gen-AI technolo - gies and their impacts on BE-CSR principles is a practical tool for decision-makers, helping them align technological choices with ethical and social objectives. The EnGen-AI model provides distinct advantages to developed and developing countries by addressing their unique en - ergy challenges. In developed countries, where energy infrastructure is more advanced, Gen-AI implementation can precisely optimise energy consumption, further reducing CO2 emissions and enhancing efficiency across production chains. Additionally, these countries can leverage the model to comply with stringent environmental regulations, fostering innovation and maintaining global competitiveness. EnGen-AI is a vital tool for improving energy management in developing countries, enabling local businesses to utilise their energy resources more effec - tively, minimise waste, and boost economic efficiency. Moreover, the model supports social inclusion by advocating for an ethical and sus - tainable adoption of Gen-AI technologies, assisting these economies in balancing economic growth with social and environmental responsibilities.

Industrial companies in the energy sector stand to benefit significantly from Gen-AI by optimising production processes and leveraging time-series data to identify energy consump - tion patterns. This enables them to implement improvements that lower operational costs and reduce carbon emissions, all while ensuring that the chosen technologies align with ethical and social considerations. For industries outside the energy sector, EnGen-AI can be adapted to enhance energy management, leading to more intelligent resource uti - lisation and increased efficiency. The framework influence also extends to end consumers, who reap the benefits of more sustainable and responsible business practices, including potential cost savings and a reduced environmental footprint. Ultimately, EnGen-AI catalyses creating a more sustainable and ethical equilibrium among the diverse actors in the economy. The managerial insights were divided into four types: environmental, social, economic, and political. Regarding environmental insights, using Gen-AI in energy manage - ment could allow for more effective use of energy in production pro - cesses, identifying patterns in consumption through energy modelling, signalling possible energy improvements to managers, and, through these actions, reducing CO2 emissions. Concerning social insights, thanks to the EnGen-AI as a new driver, organisations could be more aware of implementing Gen-AI-related technologies for energy man - agement, always observing aspects related to BE and CSR, and main - taining the inclusion and development of humans as the centre of activities. Regarding economic insights, the EnGen-AI could promote more efficient energy use in production processes, support demand forecasting, eliminate waste, and thus increase the company ’ s profits. Regarding political insights, the EnGen-AI can guide changes in political regulations for using Gen-AI, ensuring better worker conditions. 6. Conclusions In addressing the comprehensive research goals, this study has offered valuable insights into integrating Gen-AI technologies for energy efficiency on BE-CSR principles, highlighting how Gen-AI influences BE- CSR principles to enhance energy management practices. The results demonstrate that different Gen-AI technologies play distinct roles in influencing specific BE-CSR principles, offering a comprehensive insight into the diverse effects of Gen-AI on ethical and societal energy man - agement practices. Also, the study delved into identifying which Gen-AI- related technologies impact BE and CSR principles, elucidating the nuanced relationships between technologies such as GANs, GLMs, RNNs, CNNs, VAEs, and GNNs and different facets of BE-CSR principles. The research aimed to identify critical priority areas for improving func - tional energy management performance through Gen-AI practices, of - fering a strategic framework for organisations to implement these technologies. In addition to differentiating strategies based on the development level of the countries, the framework also provides a classification of the ethical and social impacts associated with these technologies. This study significantly contributes to the literature by introducing the EnGen-AI framework, a novel tool for integrating Gen-AI technolo - gies into energy management in alignment with BE-CSR principles. It deepens understanding of how technologies like GANs, GLMs, RNNs, CNNs, VAEs, and GNNs impact BE-CSR, offering a structured impact scale to improve energy management practices. Additionally, the research highlights regional differences in Gen-AI ’ s influence, linking them to cultural and economic factors and offering valuable insights into how Gen-AI is applied across developed and developing countries. On a societal level, the study addresses crucial ethical issues, including Pri - vacy and Fairness, when adopting Gen-AI technologies in energy man - agement. It offers practical, tailored solutions to enhance energy efficiency according to different countries ’ developmental levels. Furthermore, by addressing concerns over AI-driven job displacement, the research shows that these fears are overstated, helping policymakers and the public develop a more balanced understanding of Gen-AI ’ s role in the workforce.

Encouraging interdisciplinarity, with the active involvement of stakeholders, including experts in ethics, social sciences, and technology, should ensure that all perspectives are considered during the process. An essential consideration in Gen-AI studies is the potential for political bias within its underlying data. Recent research has highlighted that tools like ChatGPT may exhibit a predominant political bias, which can distort outcomes and compromise the objectivity of the recommendations provided ( Fujimoto & Take - moto, 2023; Rutinowski et al., 2024 ). This bias can distort analyses, leading to certain technologies being either favoured or overlooked rather than allowing for an impartial assessment of their ethical and social impacts. To mitigate these biases, it is crucial to incorporate regular human reviews and periodic audits to identify and address po - tential biases. Within technological determinism, a potentially overlooked trade-off in adopting Gen-AI for energy efficiency lies in the environmental impact of the expanding technological infrastructure, since with the rapid growth in demand for data centres, driven by the need for massive data processing, storage, and cooling, has led to a significant increase in energy consumption ( Baek & Lee, 2021 ). In some instances, this heightened energy demand can offset the efficiency gains that Gen-AI seeks to achieve. In other words, it is crucial to incorporate a human - — and social-centred approach to promote the continuous development of the EnGen-AI framework, adapting it transparently to new technol - ogies and ethical and social challenges so that everyone understands the evaluation criteria. Future research should explore the broader impli - cations of Gen-AI technologies in diverse industries and consider contextual variations to provide a more comprehensive understanding of their impact on BE-CSR principles. In parallel, future research can further investigate various areas to examine the environmental impact of Gen-AI adoption, particularly concerning technological infrastructure and energy consumption.

{"page_content": "How will the public respond to in-vehicle fatigue detection technology? M. Sprajcer *, M. Muchinguri, G.E. Vincent, A. Naweed Appleton Institute, Central Queensland University, Wayville, South Australia, 5034, Australia ABSTRACT Fatigue detection technology (FDT) uses physiological, behavioural and/or performance data to detect and mitigate fatigue-related risks, typically in drivers. As an emerging technology, its application has tended to concentrate on the organisational and industrial context of professional driving. However, FDT is evolving towards general consumer vehicle integration, and understanding how the public may react to it is important for identifying potential issues and ensuring its design enhances road safety in both concept and practice. Six semi-structured focus groups were conducted with Australian road users (n = 23) to understand factors impacting FDT acceptance and uptake, in addition to identifying potential implications for policy and practice. Thematic analysis identified a total of 10 factors across the individual and broader system levels. Findings suggest that the public has ambivalence towards FDT, holding strong positive and negative views. While firm beliefs were held about the potential safety benefits of FDT, individual-level challenges associated with data privacy, the everyday user experience, and accuracy of the technology were identified. Moreover, system-level factors, such as the regulatory landscape and built environment were seen as potentially impacting acceptance and uptake. Notably, many of the beliefs held may not wholly reflect the capabilities of the technology or regulatory practices. Regulatory agencies may need to consider public education about the usage and capabilities of FDT for it to be accepted by consumers, in addition to establishing clear guidance and regulation around use. 1. Introduction Estimates indicate that approximately 20% of vehicle crashes in Australia are, at least in part, caused by fatigue ( Thomas et al., 2021 ). Similar rates have been reported internationally, with up to 25% of crashes in Germany ( Wei, 2010 ), 17.6% of fatal vehicle crashes in the United States ( Tefft, 2024 ), and 20% of vehicle crashes in the United Kingdom ( Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents, 2024 ) attrib - uted to fatigue. These crashes generally occur due to the physiological and psychological consequences of fatigue, which includes diminished situational awareness, poor response times, compromised decision-making, and occurrences of microsleeps ( Philip et al., 2005 ). Importantly, crashes causally attributed to fatigue tend to be more se - vere, particularly where the driver has fallen asleep at the wheel ( Tavakoli Kashani et al., 2022 ), and as a result, more likely to result in fatalities. Fatigue can be defined as “ a physiological state of reduced mental or physical performance capability resulting from sleep loss, extended wakefulness, circadian phase, and/or workload (mental and/or physical activity) that can impair a person ’ s alertness and ability to perform safety related operational duties ” ( International Air Trans - port Association & International Civil Aviation Organization, 2015 ). To mitigate fatigue-related risk in vehicle crashes, many jurisdictions have included fatigue as a key target area within road safety policy ( Commonwealth of Australia, 2018; Government of South Australia, 2023 ), invested in public education campaigns ( Adamos et al., 2013; Fletcher et al., 2005 ), and looked towards technological solutions ( Abbas et al., 2020; Doudou et al., 2020; Munala et al., 2012; Noyce et al., 2004 ). Policy and educational strategies broadly aim to keep fatigued drivers off the road, with slogans such as “ Stop, Sip, Sleep ” ( Transpoco Telematics, 2015 ) and “ A break every 2 h could save your life ” ( South Australian Police, 2024 ) used to notify the public of elevated fatigue-related risk. Similarly, policy approaches tend to focus on deterrence (e.g., fines) and behaviour change (e.g., increasing frequency of breaks). In contrast, technological solutions use the built or techno - logical environment for near miss/crash prevention in situations where a driver is experiencing fatigue behind the wheel — ostensibly where educational and/or policy approaches have not led to the desired change in behaviour. Over recent decades, technological solutions have included audio tactile line markings ( “ rumble strips ” ), rest areas, and physical barriers. However, technologies designed to identify signs of driver fatigue and mitigate risk of crashes before they occur are now being developed and deployed ( Cori et al., 2021 ). These technologies are broadly categorised Fatigue Detection Technology (FDT) or Fatigue and Distraction Detection Technology (FDDT) ( Higginson et al., 2019 ), but also known as Drowsiness Detection, Driver State Sensing, or Driver Monitoring systems. These systems employ an array", "metadata": {"producer": "Acrobat Distiller 8.1.0 (Windows)", "creator": "Elsevier", "creationdate": "2025-04-26T08:29:59+00:00", "crossmarkdomains[1]": "elsevier.com", "crossmarkmajorversiondate": "2010-04-23", "creationdate--text": "26th April 2025", "elsevierwebpdfspecifications": "7.0.1", "robots": "noindex", "moddate": "2025-04-26T10:30:06+00:00", "author": "M.

{"page_content": "current FDT is the provision of ‘alerts ’ to the user, with the aim of reducing the likelihood of a fatigue-related vehicle crash or other inci - dent ( Sikander et al., 2018 ). Recent data suggests that FDT employing ‘drowsiness detection/warnings ’ has potential to prevent > 55% of fatigue-related crashes ( Thompson & Wundersitz, 2023 ). While much of the literature to date has been focused on the tech - nical aspects of FDT (e.g., reliability, validity, functionality) ( Abbas et al., 2020; Cori et al., 2021; Mulhall et al., 2023 ), emerging alongside the technology itself is a growing body of work on the uptake and us - ability of FDT ( Higginson et al., 2019; Nandavar et al., 2023 ). To date, this has focused on drivers who use FDT occupationally, which also comprises the vast majority of current FDT users. However, there is significant potential for FDT to be integrated into new private vehicle models in the near future ( Arakawa, 2021 ). Indeed, several major vehicle manufacturers now include FDT as standard in late model ve - hicles. For example, vehicle manufacturer DS Automobiles now inte - grate the ‘DS Driver Attention Monitoring ’ system, which incorporates a driver-facing camera with continuous vehicle position monitoring into all new vehicles ( DS Automobiles, 2024 ). Similarly, Cadillac vehicles now include a driver-facing camera as part of their GM 2018 Cadillac CT6 Super Cruise System, which is designed to detect fatigue ( Cadillac, 2018 ). Other vehicle manufacturers have similar systems that provide ‘fatigue alerts ’ based on a range of behavioural, physiological, and driving inputs. These advancements have in part provoked new Euro - pean Union regulations requiring all new vehicles to be fitted with a form of FDT as of 2022 ( The European Parliament and the Council of the European Union, 2019 ). As a result, it is likely that in other jurisdictions, including Australia, we are also likely to see significant increases in vehicle manufacturers fitting new vehicles with FDT. The integration of FDT into private vehicles would ideally significantly enhance public safety, and offer a proactive measure against the global incidence (1.3 million fatalities annually; World Health Organisation ( World Health Organisation, 2022 )) of vehicle crashes and fatalities. However, the potential success of FDT, and the degree to which the technology posi - tively influences behaviour, will likely be impacted by the experiences and perceptions of users ( Davis, 1993 ). A range of factors are likely to have a strong impact on whether an individual is willing to accept, adopt, and appropriately use a novel and unfamiliar technology. While no evidence is available to the authors ’ knowledge on what impact such factors may have on the acceptance and uptake of FDT, there is a wealth of knowledge from other technological domains, including AI ( Kelly et al., 2023 ), telemedicine ( Garavand et al., 2022 ), and smartphone-based technology (e.g., on-demand services, apps) ( Min et al., 2021 ). It is apparent that negative perceptions, regardless of their accuracy, are strongly related to these outcomes ( Garavand et al., 2022; Kelly et al., 2023; Min et al., 2021 ). In the case of autonomous vehicles — a domain with features arguably similar to FDT — a range of factors are likely to directly influence whether an in - dividual is likely to choose to use such a vehicle ( Dichabeng et al., 2021 ). Factors likely to impact acceptance and uptake of the technology broadly relate to both individual- and system-level benefits that poten - tial users believe will occur. Abstract societal benefit (e.g., safety im - provements, reduced traffic congestion in the case of autonomous vehicles) may not be sufficient for acceptance and uptake ( Dichabeng et al., 2021 ). Similarly, many factors, including usability, trust, external conditions, and usefulness, may impact resistance to a technology ( Kamal et al., 2020; Naweed et al., 2018 ), and even at times sabotage in situations where (like FDT) it may be unavoidable to use the technology ( Cappuccio et al., 2023 ) (e.g., if a specific piece of software or smart - phone application must be used to access healthcare ( Kamal et al., 2020 ), or in this case, if FDT comes pre-installed in a vehicle). When considering potential factors that may impact public accep - tance of FDT, we can look to the advent of other novel technologies that have been developed and implemented in recent years.

Similarly, many factors, including usability, trust, external conditions, and usefulness, may impact resistance to a technology ( Kamal et al., 2020; Naweed et al., 2018 ), and even at times sabotage in situations where (like FDT) it may be unavoidable to use the technology ( Cappuccio et al., 2023 ) (e.g., if a specific piece of software or smart - phone application must be used to access healthcare ( Kamal et al., 2020 ), or in this case, if FDT comes pre-installed in a vehicle). When considering potential factors that may impact public accep - tance of FDT, we can look to the advent of other novel technologies that have been developed and implemented in recent years. The Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) ( Davis et al., 1989 ) is a common framework used to evaluate such factors that has found widespread application. The TAM has been used to frame acceptance and uptake of similar tech - nology, including the likely acceptance of fully and partially autono - mous vehicles ( Chen et al., 2023; Koul et al., 2018 ), virtual reality technologies ( Sagnier et al., 2020 ), and financial technology ( Singh et al., 2020 ). Key elements of this model include the perceived useful - ness of the technology, perceived ease of use, behavioural intentions to use the technology, and the impact of external or system-level factors (e. g., organisational or systemic contexts). While the TAM has not been applied to FDT, it is likely that the key factors identified in the model will inform public acceptance and uptake of this technology, much like other novel technologies. Failure to address public perceptions of emerging technologies carries potential for adverse consequences and widespread rejection of the technology ( Klein et al., 2020 ). Therefore, it is critical to understand and navigate the factors likely to impact acceptance and uptake of emerging technologies. This may help avert potential backlash but also ensure that FDT has the best chance of positively impacting road safety. Therefore, the research questions addressed by this study are. RQ1. What factors are likely to influence public acceptance and up - take of FDT? RQ2. What are the implications for policy and practice? 2. Methods 2.1. Study design This study employed a qualitative orientation and focus group methodology to collect data from road users on their views about FDT. This was selected to gather deep and personalised insights into the public ’ s perception of FDT ( Naweed et al., 2017a, 2017b ). The research was grounded in the ontology of critical realism ( Bhaskar, 2013 ), enabling us to posit that while FDT operates within an objective reality independent of individual perceptions, the ways in which FDT is un - derstood and accepted by the public are shaped by social, cultural, and psychological factors. This ontology allows exploration of the tension between the actual capabilities of FDT and the socially constructed be - liefs of road users, particularly in terms of its perceived risks and ben - efits. Epistemologically, the research adopted a constructivist approach ( Guba et al., 1994 ), recognising that knowledge about FDT acceptance and uptake is co-created through subjective experiences and interactions of individuals. Through these philosophical perspectives, the study design illuminated both the objective realities of FDT integration into consumer vehicles and the social constructions shaping public attitudes. 2.2. Participants and recruitment Inclusion criteria for the study included age ( ≥ 18 years old), ownership of a current driving license, and residency in Australia. Convenience and snowball sampling methods were used to recruit suf - ficient participants to achieve saturation ( Clarke et al., 2013 ). Saturation was determined when no new themes or ideas were deemed to be emerging from focus groups. Recruitment occurred via social media, through existing researcher networks, and physical posters placed on university campus notice boards. The sampling process aimed to capture a diverse range of people living in Australia. Given that FDT is only recently emerging in the Australian private vehicle market, it is likely that within this target population, there would be limited prior experi - ence with the technology. However, prior experience was not used as an inclusion or exclusion criteria. Potential participants expressed interest via following a link included in advertising materials. Upon following the link, participants were provided with an information sheet through an online expression of interest survey (Qualtrics, Provo, UT) explaining the purpose of the study. After reading the information sheet, partici - pants provided electronic consent along with their age, phone number, email address, citizenship status, state and region of residence, M.

However, prior experience was not used as an inclusion or exclusion criteria. Potential participants expressed interest via following a link included in advertising materials. Upon following the link, participants were provided with an information sheet through an online expression of interest survey (Qualtrics, Provo, UT) explaining the purpose of the study. After reading the information sheet, partici - pants provided electronic consent along with their age, phone number, email address, citizenship status, state and region of residence, M.

These data were used to screen against in - clusion criteria, and participants who met the criteria were contacted and booked in to attend a focus group. A total of 23 road users participated in this study (14 female; 35 ± 13 years; age range: 24 – 75 years), with focus groups including 3 – 6 par - ticipants (focus group 1 = 6 participants; focus group 2 = 3 participants; focus group 3 = 3 participants; focus group 4 = 3 participants; focus group 5 = 5 participants; focus group 6 = 3 participants). Participant country of birth included Australia (n = 16), Denmark (n = 1), New Zealand (n = 1), Colombia (n = 1), South Africa (n = 1), Papua New Guinea (n = 1), Ethiopia (n = 1), and Zimbabwe (n = 1). Participants lived in urban (n = 6), regional (n = 14), rural (n = 2), and remote (n = 1) locations across Queensland (n = 17), New South Wales (n = 3), South Australia (n = 2), and Western Australia (n = 1). On average, participants reported driving for 4.9 ± 6.2 h per week. 2.3. Procedure Focus groups were undertaken via online videoconference (Zoom, San Jose, California), lasted ~88 min ( ± 9.9 min), and transcribed with each participant assigned unique identifiers (i.e., ID tag made up of focus group and participant numbers) to ensure anonymity. Focus group data were collected using a semi-structured approach. As shown in Table 1, most questions were open-ended; this was to elicit perspectives, attitudes, and personal feelings about potential use of FDT, and encourage a comprehensive analysis. Participants were asked to describe their perspectives and attitudes about FDT, with a focus on how they felt personally about potentially using such technology. Focus groups covered: introduction to FDT; relationships with fa - tigue; feelings about FDT; concerns about FDT; potential benefits of FDT; barriers to using FDT, and how FDT could be improved. Participation was compensated via an AU$50 Prezzee Smart e-gift card honorarium. The protocol was piloted and refined before use. Ethical approval was provided by the institutional Human Research Ethics Committee (Approval no: 2022-026). 2.4. Data analysis Focus group data were thematically analysed to identify themes through open and axial coding ( Braun et al., 2006 ). The first process of the thematic analysis was to transcribe the data and organise it ortho - graphically. The transcription phase was then followed by the three stages of thematic analysis: immersion, coding, and categorisation of the data ( Naweed, 2017a, 2017b; Naweed, Bowditch, Trigg, & Unsworth, 2020 ). In the immersion process, data were read line by line, and con - ceptual memos were made in reference to the research questions to capture ideas. Data were organised based on the similarity to other data in the focus groups and analysed inductively, meaning that all codes emerged through analysis (i.e., no a-priori code formulation). Initial codes were refined into central themes. NVivo (version 14.23.2) was used for initial open data coding and to assist with taking notes and visualising the data to answer the research question (NVivo, 2023). Each transcript from the focus groups was double-checked against identified codes systematically to ensure consistency, with repeated checks of understanding to verify accurate representation of coded data. During analysis, one or two researchers led/co-led analysis, but in each step, coding and refinement occurred through continuous engagement in mutual reflexive dialogue and consensus seeking. This ensured a common understanding of the concepts/theoretical frame - work underpinning the study during the coding process, and consistency in coding decisions ( M ø ller et al., 2022 ). Under the TAM, factors impacting technology acceptance can be broadly categorised as being at the personal/individual level or at a broader system level. The TAM was therefore used as a framework to interpret findings following the development of initial themes. 3. Results In line with the TAM, thematic analysis identified themes that fell into different groupings: factors influencing acceptance and uptake of FDT at the individual-level and the system-level.

The next sections present the factors in two sections based on these groupings in turn. 3.1. Individual-level factors influencing acceptance and uptake of FDT Six individual-level themes were identified based on a total of 540 coded references: (1) Positive reinforcement, (2) Operational accuracy of technology, (3) Personal autonomy and control, (4) User experience and functionality, (5) Scepticism and distrust, and (6) Target users. Themes, along with aligned factors and concepts discussed in focus groups can be seen in Table 2 ( Pabel et al., 2022 ). 3.1.1. Positive reinforcement Most participants highlighted that FDT could be helpful for detecting fatigue and expressed a willingness to engage with such technology. Existing beliefs about the perceived safety benefits of FDT, for example, were an enabling factor: “ [FDT is] a good thing. It ’ s for the safety of everyone on the road ” (FG5P1). The inclination to use FDT in order to remain safe arose because of lived experience with fatigue, FDT, or other similar technologies. For example, in the case of a brand of FDT that was integrated with the vehicle: I actually didn ’ t know our car had it, till I was driving one night and I kind of had a microsleep. It kind of pulled me straight … that was my experience with it. It probably did save my life (FG3P3). Participants also reported positive experiences with other driver assistance technologies, such as lane assist, and pre-collision technology. Based on their experiences, participants indicated that while technology may not always function correctly, it was more beneficial to have it than forgo it: “ Yeah, I definitely [would] use [FDT]. Just nice to have it there as an extra safety feature ” (FG1P2). Some drivers had no prior experience with FDT but expressed a strong desire to trial it and experience its functionality firsthand before committing to using it in their own vehicle: “ I ’ d want to be able to trial and use it and think, is this useful or not? ” (FG5P5). 3.1.2. Operational accuracy of technology Participants discussed an unwillingness to use FDT if it was not reliable (i.e., functioning correctly) and/or valid (i.e., being able to correctly identify when the driver is or is not experiencing fatigue). For participants, the concepts of reliability and validity intersected, coming together to form what they termed “ accuracy ” (FG5P5). FDT was seen to Table 1 Semi-structured interview protocol for the focus groups. Topics Example Questions Introduction What is FDT?

{"page_content": "have an inherent complexity which tended to be interpreted negatively, for example, one participant said “a simple approach could be just what’s needed” rather than the “bells and whistles” they believed FDT would come with (FG6P1). Most participants believed that false positives would be a significant problem: I just think if [the FDT] was going off and it wasn’t actually accurate, you know, that would be annoying. And you wouldn’t rely on it or trust it anymore - I think that’s the risk (FG5P5). Concerns about validity also stemmed from perceived difficulties of having a standardised measurement to detect actual fatigue. Numerous focus groups raised discussion about some drivers not showing physical symptoms of fatigue despite being tired, and others displaying physical symptoms of fatigue but without feeling fatigued: “Some people can be exhausted [and] not even look tired at all. Is the technology going to … be enough” (FG2P3). Some types of FDT were considered to more likely be accurate than others, however only three participants indicated that they would want scientific evidence to be available to provide confi - dence in the validity of the technology. 3.1.3. Personal autonomy and control Some focus groups discussed a concern about losing autonomy and control (i.e., personal choice) with use of FDT. It was thought that FDT could pave the way for the government or for their organisations to eventually take control their vehicles remotely and prevent them from driving were fatigue to be detected. The notion of FDT impinging on ‘freedom’ was thus a key point; participants debated whether improving road safety for all was worth placing restrictions on when a fatigued driver could drive, or if this was going a step too far. The ethics and morality was therefore called into question: When can the government or other authorities restrict my freedom in order to preserve the common good? There are all those sorts of moral implications of technology (FG3P1). The ability for people to choose which type or brand of FDT they could use was considered to influence community uptake of FDT. This extended to specific features or characteristics of the technology, including choice on alert feedback (e.g., notification type, type of audio) and other technology characteristics. Some participants indicated that drivers would choose to drive while fatigued because they would rely on the technology to wake them if they fell asleep. Overreliance on FDT was therefore a key point for autonomy and control, and believed to create potential for crashes and near misses. This was particularly in cases where drivers were seen to no longer consider it their responsibility to ensure they were sufficiently alert to drive safely. Building a reliance on FDT was also thought to have the Table 2 Individual-level themes, factors, and concepts affecting public perceptions of FDT.

{"page_content": "effect of overriding other fatigue management strategies, such as taking sufficient rest breaks during long drives. The relationship between reactivity and proactivity of FDT was dis - cussed, with the general view that identifying fatigue after the driver was fatigued rather than beforehand was a limitation. This was seen as problematic because of a belief that late intervention was less effective for preventing fatigue, and therefore, fatigue-related crashes. Despite this, interpretations of FDT as a ‘last resort’ was appreciated if all other countermeasures had failed: [FDT] is like an airbag. I’m not [going to] put my face into it … [and] get into an accident [just] because it is there. It is an absolute last resort and not something I am going to take more risks just because the technology exists in the car (sic; FG1P6) All focus groups brought up data privacy and protection of personal information as factors influencing FDT acceptance and uptake. FDT was believed to collect sensitive driver data, such as video footage and driving performance, and possess inherent vulnerabilities to data breaches, leaving people exposed. Concern was also expressed about what data regulatory bodies or enforcement agencies could access. Data that could be interpreted as a person ‘doing the wrong thing’ (driving while knowingly fatigued), or including video footage, were primary concerns, especially if accessed externally regardless of intent. Many discussions used the metaphor of ‘Big Brother,’ particularly in relation to driver-facing cameras and similar technological options, drawing no - tions of an omniscient and dictatorial power gazing into their lives. The government or other external parties were suggested to be able to use FDT to keep track of people’s behaviour or conversations: “in theory, [FDT] can pick up private conversations without permission from the user … you know, being watched by Big Brother” (FG3P2). 3.1.4. User experience and functionality The experience of receiving alerts was discussed at length in all focus groups, and underscored by a strong belief that FDT alerts would be “annoying”, and have the effect of eroding trust in the technology with drivers removing or turning it off altogether. Moreover, some thought that if drivers did not know how to respond to alerts, or could choose not to act following an alert, there would be no value to FDT. Some felt that competing needs could override alerts: “I already know I’m fatigued, and if I have somewhere to go, I’m probably not really gonna listen to it, like that’s just honest truth” (FG6P1). Despite a lack of experience with FDT, some participants held beliefs and corresponding attitudes that FDT was underdeveloped, and would only use it if it were improved. This attitude was perhaps tied to the novelty of the technology; one participant, for example, noted that FDT should expand its remit and detect more than just fatigue, as “fatigue is just one problem that we have to face when it comes to drivers’ safety and behaviour” (FG2P1). This resonated with extensive discussions about customising and personalising FDT. Some wanted it to be calibrated to their own signs and symptoms of fatigue: [I’d] have my [FDT] be specific to me. Pick up my trends, or when I get fatigued. Am I blinking too much? Am I yawning too much? For me? (FG3P3). In addition to customisations, participants described innovating FDT so that it could change the vehicle climate or intelligently emit alerts, for example: “I’d want it to be a tone that doesn’t freak me out and give me like a heart attack when I’m driving” (FG4P3). The relative merits of in-vehicle cameras in comparison to other types of FDT (e.g., wearables) were discussed and debated in terms of austerity. For example, one suggestion was that, rather than inside the vehicle, fatigue should be detected by roadside cameras and lead to police action/fines to provoke a deterrence effect similar to speeding. A highly sophisticated FDT design was thought to be problematic if it made the FDT challenging to use while driving. For example, several participants indicated that if FDT notifications were shown on the vehicle dashboard, it may distract those attempting to respond (e.g., trying to find a specific button on the steering wheel). There was also a belief that FDT should be designed to be more seamlessly integrated with the driving environment: I would want the alert to come up on the heads-up display on the windscreen rather than on the dashboard because presently, I have got to take my eyes off the road to read the message (FG3P1). For FDT to be user friendly, the prevalent view was that it would need to be both unintrusive and aesthetically pleasing but also that notifications", "metadata": {"producer": "Acrobat Distiller 8.1.0 (Windows)", "creator": "Elsevier", "creationdate": "2025-04-26T08:29:59+00:00", "crossmarkdomains[1]": "elsevier.com", "crossmarkmajorversiondate": "2010-04-23", "creationdate--text": "26th April 2025", "elsevierwebpdfspecifications": "7.0.1", "robots": "noindex", "moddate": "2025-04-26T10:30:06+00:00", "author": "M.

For FDT to be user friendly, the prevalent view was that it would need to be both unintrusive and aesthetically pleasing but also that notifications should be sufficiently “assertive” to encourage safer behaviour on the road. Showing a fatigue detection alert on the dash - board alone was believed to not sufficiently improve driving behaviour (e.g., stopping to rest when fatigued). Participants discussed the potential for FDT to introduce additional hazards and noted that this may inadvertently lead to poor safety out - comes. For example, if the driver displayed signs of fatigue, the warning, such as seat vibration or steering wheel nudges, could startle the driver, and lead to steering overcorrection. Similarly, many believed that FDT could distract drivers and increase the likelihood of a crash, particularly in contexts where vehicles have a number of existing alerts and alarms across other domains: They [could] be quite distracting … if you have all these different gadgets and things that make sounds and [are] saying different things, there’s so many places where your eye could wander. That’s not a good thing at all (FG2P1). 3.1.5. Scepticism and distrust Distrust of information from new technology was a prevalent dis - cussion point in focus groups, and often associated with commentary around AI. Several participants believed scepticism and distrust in the capabilities of FDT would be widespread, though others noted trust would increase as people grew more comfortable with the technology and gained confidence in the accuracy of FDT. A few indicated that they would not trust FDT to function as advertised, and many believed that it may actually cause vehicle crashes due to automated response to inac - curate readings. I made a decision … to swerved away from [an] accident … I was able to make that decision in a split second. But the AI would only be programmed to do one or the other, it won’t be able to weigh up the pros and cons (FG2P2). FDT was suggested to potentially misinterpret driver behaviour (i.e., avoiding a potential road obstacle as a sign of fatigue), and take control, which would result in other issues. One focus group had a spirted debate about others’ experiences of FDTs, with most not trusting user reviews when deciding whether or not to use FDT. A minority thought that user reviews may make them more likely to use the technology, particularly if testimonials came from people they knew: “I’d probably wait for a friend to get something and then try that out” (FG5P5). 3.1.6. Target users The potential for FDT to have greater negative consequences for specific populations was a large point of discussion. One focus group discussed the deontology of FDT limiting their ability to get to and from work, believing that the legal consequences of driving with detectable levels of fatigue would impact this. The prominent belief was that, un - like the decision to drive while impaired for another reason (e.g., alcohol or illicit drugs), the decision to drive while fatigued was often beyond the control of the individual. Many held the belief that people should not be penalised for circumstances beyond their control, such as family re - sponsibilities, extended commutes, and shift work. Concerns were also raised around disproportionate impact to people with lower socio- economic status: M. Sprajcer et al.

They’re gonna be the ones doing two casual jobs who are more likely to be detected as fatigued … [FDT] could be a big sociopolitical issue (FG3P1). Some participants believed that certain groups would be more or less willing or able to use FDT. FDT was believed to be useful for those who had to drive long distances as part of their employment, but they stopped short of believing it would also be useful for themselves: I like the idea of truck drivers using it … a signal to their manager who can give him a quick call, or, you know, over the radio and just be like, ‘hey, mate, are you okay?’ Would you like to pull over? We have got an [alert] that I agree with. But my personal use probably would not be too beneficial (FG5P1). Some believed that FDT may have most utility for regional or rural locations, rather than metropolitan. The view was that FDT would work better when undertaking long distance driving than city driving, where driver behaviours would involve more movement (e.g., merging, changing lanes). It was also suggested that FDT would struggle to detect fatigue in populations with specific physical features. The general attitude here was that FDT should be customisable for people with a range of physical characteristics, and inclusive for people with physical disabilities. This level of customisation was perceived to be critical to ensure that the technology could be effective for everyone. Despite this, particular emphasis was placed on populations more likely to be exposed to high levels of fatigue. Shift workers and new parents were considered to be at greater risk of a fatigue-related vehicle crash, therefore thought to be more likely to see safety benefit from using FDT. One participant described strong feelings about the use of FDT in young or inexperienced drivers, suggesting that parents would feel much safer if their teenage children had FDT installed: I have a daughter who’s about 17 and got her provisional license. That’s a whole other lever level of terrifying to me … I’m really concerned about her safety on the road … So I think especially for inexperienced drivers, it could be really handy for them, and I’d get it for her. (FG5P5) However, not all community members were believed to readily accept FDT, particularly older populations, or those accustomed to driving vehicles without sophisticated technology. 3.2. System-level factors influencing acceptance and uptake of FDT Four system-level themes were identified based on a total of 183 coded references: (1) Insufficient infrastructure and cost, (2) Legal considerations, (3) Regulation, and (4) Education and training. Themes, along with aligned factors and concepts discussed in focus groups can be seen in Table 3 ( Pabel et al., 2022 ). 3.2.1. Insufficient infrastructure and cost Focus group discussions displayed a belief that the cost of FDT might limit improvements to community road safety, particularly if it were inaccessible to a large proportion of the population. The general assumption was that FDT would, by its nature, be cost prohibitive to buy, regardless of whether devices were purchased aftermarket (and installed into/used while driving existing vehicles) or if they came as standard with new vehicles. Addition of FDT into vehicles was consid - ered to increase purchase price, rendering the vehicle more out of reach: Every time you add more technology, [it’s] gonna add more money to the cost of the vehicle. So are people going to be able to pay for it?” (FG6P1). The general belief was that in new cars, FDT should already be in - tegrated (i.e., before market) with no added cost, and that technology vendors and regulators should retrofit FDT into older vehicles. People of low socio-economic status and/or younger drivers were considered to find it challenging to afford FDT; several participants held a belief that younger drivers generally purchased cheaper, older cars, without high- quality safety technology. Issues with infrastructure and driving environment were also considered to impact the willingness to use FDT. Use of FDT was imagined to mean that, at times, drivers would need to pull over mid- drive were fatigue were detected. As a result, an increased need for rest stops was discussed, particularly for long distance drives. This was raised as an issue because many believed that the current number of rest stops, and distances between them, would be insufficient if fatigue were detected by an FDT while driving. The concern was that FDT feedback may not have any real impact on driver behaviour, as drivers would simply have to keep", "metadata": {"producer": "Acrobat Distiller 8.1.0 (Windows)", "creator": "Elsevier", "creationdate": "2025-04-26T08:29:59+00:00", "crossmarkdomains[1]": "elsevier.com", "crossmarkmajorversiondate": "2010-04-23", "creationdate--text": "26th April 2025", "elsevierwebpdfspecifications": "7.0.1", "robots": "noindex", "moddate": "2025-04-26T10:30:06+00:00", "author": "M.

Absolutely not. You know it’s not safe. (FG2P2) It was also believed that drivers would avoid stopping at night due to feeling unsafe. Not feeling safe on the road was discussed to stem from low signal/network connections, the “scary” setting of some stops, and because many rest stops were in isolated locations.

{"page_content": "particularly pronounced in relation to using rest stops/other facilities at night, and for female participants, who said they would be unwilling to stop for a break or nap due to safety concerns: “the idea of being by myself on the side of the road and actually having a rest … creates this vulnerability” (FG4P3). Digital infrastructure was also considered with one focus group discussing how large-scale use of FDT data could be used to identify fatigue ‘hot spots’ with government resourcing directed to support road safety. Population-level FDT data was imagined to ideally be “integrated with civil infrastructure” (FG4P1) to determine where it may be most appropriate to build additional rest stops. The potential for using FDT collected data in this manner—rather than solely as part of a driver-FDT feedback loop—was generally viewed as a positive. 3.2.2. Legal considerations Concerns were expressed about the legal implications of FDT use, and the data collected by FDTs carrying legal implications for people. There was a general belief that enforcement agencies would penalise drivers for lack of compliance with rules associated with FDT use, and their data would be legally discoverable. For example, FDT would monitor peoples’ habits, and record and keep their data, which would then be used as evidence to prosecute them. In relation to this, a popular scenario discussed was that of a driver ignoring FDT warnings and continued driving: Most people’s concern would be, you know, how am I going to be more liable? Or charged? And is that data kept? And can that data be used against me? In a court of law, that might say … that that person showed signs of fatigue an hour before the crash. (FG4P1). In conjunction with the individual-level factors on user experience and functionality, many believed that FDT should be a “friendly helper” with alerts supporting people to make better decisions, but that this information should not be available to the police or have legal impli - cations even in an at-fault vehicle crash scenario: “it would be safer if whatever information we want to keep is kept in a closed loop … or imme - diately deleted” (FG3P2). Despite apparent mixed feelings about the potential acceptability of FDT, most focus groups discussed the potential consequences of driving while fatigued at length, and generally felt that harsher deterrence may be required to improve driver behaviour. Many believed current deter - rence strategies were not strong enough, regardless of whether FDT data could be incorporated into legal frameworks. Some believed that road safety could be improved by combining deterrents with FDT driver monitoring: “people get off very lightly. And it just feels like we need to create some incentive for good behaviour on the road” (FG4P2). 3.2.3. Regulation Regulation was observed as a particularly important element in organisational and professional driving contexts, in cases where drivers used FDT in their work vehicles. A few focus groups discussed com - panies and individuals both needing guidance on how to use FDT and react to a fatigue alert. Debate focused on what actions would be appropriate in the event of an alert, including whether people should stop driving after the first alert, or whether there should be a graded approach to actions taken post-alert. The concern was that specific ac - tions would be required if an alert occurred, regardless of whether it was a ‘false positive’ (i.e., when the driver was not actually fatigued). However, ambivalence was expressed about whether drivers should, or indeed could, be trusted to evaluate their own fatigue in this scenario. The main view was that in work contexts, drivers should be permitted to stop driving if an FDT alert occurred, or if they believed they were not sufficiently alert to drive safely, with FDT data used by the workers themselves to “prove” to their employers that they were too fatigued to continue: “[FDT] could be used as sort of evidence to say, look, I couldn’t push on because the technology kicked in” (FG1P2). A general belief was that FDT would need to be regulated, including regulations to ensure it functioned as intended, and to ensure appro - priate organisational use: “I think it needs to be carefully regulated … It couldn’t just be used recklessly” (FG3P1). It was noted that FDT could be used by organisations to establish whether a professional driver was fit to work. Lastly potential insurance implications of FDT use were dis - cussed, with some believing that information collected via FDT would impact insurance premiums and whether this meant that claims would be paid out: The insurance company can ask you if you have had the technology before … [and] if you get a score … that might determine how much you have to pay [for] your insurance cover", "metadata": {"producer": "Acrobat Distiller 8.1.0 (Windows)", "creator": "Elsevier", "creationdate": "2025-04-26T08:29:59+00:00", "crossmarkdomains[1]": "elsevier.com", "crossmarkmajorversiondate": "2010-04-23", "creationdate--text": "26th April 2025", "elsevierwebpdfspecifications": "7.0.1", "robots": "noindex", "moddate": "2025-04-26T10:30:06+00:00", "author": "M.

Education and training Discussion adopted a general view that drivers needed more educa - tion about fatigue, and how to manage its risks, regardless of whether or not FDT was in use. For some, limited deterrence value was believed to be had with punitive measures (e.g., fines) than with education, which was expected to lead to greater behavioural change. Limitations of current driver training practices were also perceived and questioned “if we’re really educating younger people when they get their licenses” (FG5P5). Some indicated that while FDT may be useful, their own preference would be to support additional driver training rather than relying on technology; however, if FDT was used, the strong consensus was to appropriately train and educate people on how to use FDT with infor - mation on how the technology itself functioned and on what to do when alerts occurred. The potential for FDT as a learning tool to support driver behaviour was discussed. Some indicated that while FDT may not be able to “force” people to behave in a certain way (e.g., stop driving), the information it provided could still be a valuable feedback loop to improve their be - haviours. Discussion points included helping individuals to become more aware of their own signs and symptoms of fatigue while driving to reduce the number of alerts (and therefore amount of time spent driving with a high level of fatigue) over time. Lastly, several participants discussed how the widespread roll out of FDT could be perceived by the public, and generally believed that educating drivers about FDT, including targeted advertisements and marketing, would help gain public acceptance. There was the sense that if appropriate education was not provided, public backlash and rejection would ensue, particularly in relation to types of FDT that incorporates in-vehicle cameras: It comes down to effective marketing and consistent messaging … so [they have an] understanding of what the fatigue detection tech - nology does and why it’s actually there. (FG1P2) 4. Discussion This study aimed to understand the factors likely to influence public acceptance and uptake of FDT (RQ1) and the implications of this for policy and practice around consumer use (RQ2). A large number and range of individual- and system-level factors were identified, with be - liefs and attitudes showing ambivalence toward FDT, its benefits, drawbacks and challenges. Factors associated with the individual and FDT itself (e.g., accuracy, user experience) would practically impact day-to-day acceptance and functionality, while system-level factors shed light on the broader regulatory and legal landscape occupied by this type of technology.

{"page_content": "multiply to influence acceptance and uptake of FDT for an individual person. The inner Venn and concentric circles (representing system-level factors) convey the main relationships established via our analysis, which is between-level (i.e., the individual level and the system level). The factors identified to potentially impact the usability and accep - tance of FDT align closely with the TAM theoretical framework and helps us to understand it in the context of existing knowledge around technology acceptance. It is apparent that factors impacting the accep - tance of other technologies (e.g., autonomous vehicles), which align with the TAM, may similarly impact acceptance of FDT. Therefore, the TAM seems to be a suitable model for understanding FDT acceptance. The application of the TAM to the FDT context is a clear novel contri - bution of the present study, which has been the first to undertake a qualitative investigation of public attitudes towards FDT. This study therefore represents both a strong theoretical and methodological contribution to the FDT literature. For Australian road users, individual- level factors strongly aligned with those expected under the TAM (i.e., perceived usefulness and ease of use). Positive sentiment was shared regarding potential safety benefits of FDT (i.e., usefulness) and the belief that FDT would be easy to interact with (i.e., ease of use). Conversely, problems with either of these were associated with negative perspec - tives. Specifically, if FDT was not accurate or resulted in negative out - comes for the driver (i.e., low perceived usefulness), there was less acceptance and intention to use the technology. Similarly, technological complexity and operational difficulties could be considered evidence of poor ‘ease of use ’ – and were similarly associated with poor acceptance. Under the TAM, external or system-level factors are also considered an important contributing factor towards technology uptake and use. The findings of the present study strongly indicate that such factors, including infrastructure, education, and the regulatory/legal context, would likely play a large role in FDT uptake and usability. As a result, it appears that the TAM could be used to model future acceptance and uptake of FDT. This aligns with the applicability of the TAM to user acceptance and uptake of similar technology, such as autonomous ve - hicles ( Panagiotopoulos et al., 2018; Wu et al., 2019 ), wearable fatigue monitoring technology ( Strong, 2020 ), and smartphone-based driver assistance systems ( Voinea et al., 2020 ), where usefulness, ease of use, and environmental/systemic factors are strong predictors of intention to use. Strong beliefs about the potential safety benefits of FDT for man - aging driver fatigue — a perennial problem — were shared, even as these were balanced by equally strong concerns. The latter ranged from ethical considerations around the impact of FDT on vulnerable groups, to issues around personal choice, data privacy, and legal implications. This ambivalence reflected sentiments from the public around analo - gous emerging technologies, including autonomous vehicles ( Kacperski et al., 2021 ), robots ( Dang et al., 2021 ), digital health interventions ( Marent et al., 2018 ), and new energy vehicles ( Zhang et al., 2023 ). Attitudinal ambivalence, characterised by an individual holding con - current positive and negative feelings ( Thompson et al., 2014 ), may be a logical response to theoretical future scenarios with which the individ - ual has limited prior experience. In the present study, nearly all who took part had no prior experience with FDT, and while a small number did, ambivalent responses were common across both. Technology is often associated with a disconnect between beliefs and actions ( Barth et al., 2019 ), for example, many social media users claim to have strong concerns about data privacy and data sharing, but continue to both use social media platforms and share their personal information online ( Hargittai et al., 2016 ). Such a response may also occur with FDT engagement (particularly if they come as standard in new vehicles), despite holding negative feelings. In view of this, protecting personal Fig. 1.

{"page_content": "data, and clearly communicating what protections are in place, may be paramount before introducing the technology to the public. A range of beliefs were held about how driving performance may be impacted by FDT, both positively and negatively, and included potential new hazards (e.g., distraction or over-reliance). Beliefs were also held regarding the potential for FDT to accurately assess fatigue in all in - dividuals, when there are individual differences in the development of signs and symptoms of fatigue. It is possible that such beliefs may impact driver behaviour, both in terms of their willingness to use FDT, and in their trust in alerts when they do occur. In addition, while many par - ticipants believed FDT would be useful with indications that they would be likely to accept such technology, it is unclear whether this would necessarily lead to behaviour change. That is, simply having FDT in a vehicle does not necessarily mean that driving behaviour, or fatigue management strategies used by drivers (e.g., breaks), would be improved. Moreover, behaviour change caused by FDT may be unpre - dictable, and not necessarily positive. For example, it is possible that FDT use may result in overreliance and an increased willingness to drive while fatigued. In our view, strong public education, including what actions could be taken in response to FDT alerts, alongside FDT rollout, would be critical to support appropriate behaviour change. Concerns were also raised about potential consequences of FDT, in cases where drivers felt (correctly or incorrectly) that they would not be able to drive. This may be more problematic for some socio- demographic groups over others. Such concerns should not be dis - missed; for any novel technology, unintended consequences risk damaging effects for users or the community more broadly ( Rosenbaum et al., 2022 ). For FDT specifically, experiences of technology roll out among certain user groups (i.e., professional driving populations) cannot be directly transposed to the general public, due to great dif - ferences in demographic factors, driving experience, vehicle type, training and education, and organisational safety systems ( Mooren et al., 2014; Short, 2014 ). Therefore, we cannot assume to know what all consequences of FDT will be for the public. It will therefore be important for regulatory and enforcement bodies in addition to technology ven - dors, to monitor and track the direct impact of FDT among the public, and for future research to evaluate both the short- and long-term impacts of use. Additionally, FDT developers need to address the intended use of FDT, and highlight how it can be utilised to assist driving instead of resulting in complete reliance on the technology. Legal and regulatory concerns with using FDT included penalties and loss of driving privileges, particularly in cases where drivers do not act in response to fatigue alerts. This aligns with evidence from the Australian road transport industry, and potential legal and privacy issues based on the commercial setting of FDT utilisation ( Dawson et al., 2014 ). This has also been reflected in the perceptions and concerns of drivers in the road transport industry who have experience with FDT ( Higginson et al., 2019 ). Similarly, in commercial settings, organisations may face legal problems based on either the type of FDT they select, or how they choose to use that FDT ( Dawson et al., 2014 ). A recent legal case resulted in the prosecution of a road transport operator because they had FDT installed, but did not take any action after > 400 field-of-view error alerts occurred over a two-month period ( De Vaney, 2022 ). Substantive concerns raised in the present study may thus not be entirely unfounded, and it may be prudent for FDT developers and regulators to ensure greater trans - parency around the technology ’ s intended use (e.g., what actions are required when alerts/error message occur) for members of the public, including clarity around potential legal ramifications. The concerns about the intersectionality between FDT and road infrastructure (e.g., necessitating frequent rest stops in rural/remote areas, missing infrastructure) may be reasonable, particularly for those in regional areas where there can be limited opportunities for drivers to stop if fatigue is detected while they are driving ( Bunn et al., 2019; Job et al., 2017; Meuleners et al., 2017 ). Moreover, delineation, lack of bitumen quality, and a lack of signage in rural areas may interfere with FDT effectiveness ( Peiris et al., 2021 ). Such features of road infrastructure and the environment may interfere with the technology itself, including its capacity to accurately detect fatigue in drivers (e.g., due to limited connectivity or high levels of vibration/heat). Critically, road infrastructure must permit drivers to take appropriate action when alerts do occur.

Critically, road infrastructure must permit drivers to take appropriate action when alerts do occur. Where infrastructure components such as signage, road/shoulder width, availability of rest areas are poor, drivers may not be able to take breaks or engage in other fatigue management strategies when they need to. It is therefore not outside the realm of possibility that without adequate infrastructure, FDT may indeed not result in improved driving behaviour and overall road safety. Similarly, the interaction between FDT and other in-vehicle technologies (e.g., advanced driver assistance systems, lane keeping assistance, autonomous emergency braking) may be worth considering as FDT becomes more common. For example, in-vehicle environments that involve a range of technologies that provide alerts may increase the likelihood of ‘alarm fatigue ’, where drivers are desensitised to alarms or alerts and therefore do not respond appropriately when they occur ( Ayas et al., 2024 ). Similarly, a driving environment with too many alerts could result in annoyance in drivers – who may choose to deactivate or otherwise ignore the technology. It is likely that the effectiveness of FDT would be impacted (either positively or negatively) by either integration or competition with other technologies. While a range of beliefs and perceptions about FDT were shared, many appeared to have a limited basis in clear evidence. The belief that FDT would autonomously exert control over the vehicle if fatigue were detected was an example that defied current technological designs. The vast majority of current FDTs simply provide auditory and/or haptic alerts, without any direct impacts on vehicle behaviour ( Cori et al., 2021 ). The belief that FDT was ‘good ’ but required improvement was interesting, but the basis for it was unclear given that it was generally reported by those with no existing personal experience or education around FDT. Other beliefs similarly had limited basis in either experi - ence or established fact, including the view that fatigue manifested so variably that it this impacted the accuracy of FDT detection ( Van Don - gen et al., 2004, 2011; Åhsberg et al., 2000 ). The results reflect a range of personal experiences, opinions, and biases in perceptions of FDT. Given the novelty of FDT for many, it is arguably unsurprising that unsubstantiated beliefs were shared. That is, in the absence of public education and/or personal experience, beliefs developed without factual input. While many public beliefs may be inaccurate, these beliefs are still likely to shape behaviour ( Crow et al., 2013 ). As a result, significant public education may be needed, particularly with regard to the tech - nical capabilities of FDT, for it to be used safely and effectively. 4.1. Implications for regulation and policy on FDT use in public vehicles This study highlights several critical factors for regulators and poli - cymakers to consider as FDT becomes more prevalent in public vehicles (see Table 4 ). Data privacy and availability, including the potential for FDT data to be used for legal enforcement by policy, will need to be clarified and communicated to the public as part of any public education efforts. Moreover, safety and performance impacts of FDT use in private vehicle drivers could be monitored, in addition to identifying any un - intended consequences or hazards produced by FDT use. For example, population-level crash data would ideally begin to incorporate infor - mation about any FDT inside vehicles involved in crashes. Similarly, FDT data could be evaluated at the population level to determine direct and indirect impacts (e.g., fatigue events detected, behaviour change in users). In addition to broad regulatory considerations, public education and driver training could potentially be used to inform the public about how to use FDT to improve their safety, and about what their legal ob - ligations are when FDT is in use (e.g., what drivers are required to do when an alert occurs). It is critical to understand that FDT does not exist in a vacuum, but rather within a complex transportation ecosystem. Thus, assessment of road infrastructure needs have merit, particularly in rural and remote areas where", "metadata": {"producer": "Acrobat Distiller 8.1.0 (Windows)", "creator": "Elsevier", "creationdate": "2025-04-26T08:29:59+00:00", "crossmarkdomains[1]": "elsevier.com", "crossmarkmajorversiondate": "2010-04-23", "creationdate--text": "26th April 2025", "elsevierwebpdfspecifications": "7.0.1", "robots": "noindex", "moddate": "2025-04-26T10:30:06+00:00", "author": "M.

Regulators will also need to consider how FDT may intersect with other vehicle automation systems, navigation technolo - gies, and driver assistance features, ensuring a cohesive approach that promotes driver safety without compromising privacy or autonomy. 4.2. Strengths, limitations and future directions This study contributes to an emerging but still small body of litera - ture regarding FDT, and even less knowledge about factors impacting acceptance and uptake. It provides compelling insights into how the public may respond, however, some limitations must be considered when interpreting findings. First, participants were all based in Australia, thus findings pre - dominately reflect the perceptions of individuals based in this country. It was deemed important to undertake the study in just one jurisdiction in order to avoid potentially vast differences in regulation/legislation relating to FDT. Moreover, as FDT is not yet mandated in Australia, this context provides a unique opportunity to gain insight in a population with limited experience of FDT – but who will likely be exposed to it in the near future. Despite this, it would likely be beneficial for future research to target other populations internationally, to understand a more broad and generalisable perspective. Individual perspectives could potentially vary in jurisdictions where FDT has been in place for longer (e.g., Europe), or where there are very different legislative frameworks and enforcement around driving practices. The extended distances be - tween major cities in Australia (and associated extended periods of time many individuals spend driving) may make the issue of fatigue more salient for populations in Australia, and those with similarly extended distances. Second, the present study used a qualitative methodology, enabling in-depth discussion and collection of rich data simulating how some members of the public may react to FDT. This approach was a significant strength of the study, though the size of some smaller focus groups (e.g., three participants) was somewhat of a limitation. Small focus groups diminish the potential for ideas to be built on and develop between participants as part of group dynamics. Furthermore, the recruitment of participants from social media, on campus locations, and via existing networks, may have introduced some degree of sampling bias, poten - tially limiting representativeness. However, participants in the present study did represent a broad range of ages (24–75 years) and back - grounds, which is a significant strength. The study offers a series of factors for further research. This may be undertaken with a broader sample with the identified factors evaluated quantitively across a wider cross section of the population, and to understand the impact of different personal characteristics (e.g., age, gender, length of time holding a driver’s license), to offer a more comprehensive understanding of po - tential public responses to FDT. Finally, future research may address different types of FDT, which have different capabilities and features – in addition to potentially measuring slightly different constructs (e.g., fatigue, sleepiness, distraction). Future research would also ideally be undertaken to un - derstand how to best leverage FDT to improve driver behaviour; one pathway could for this could be an evaluation of public education strategies. 4.3. Conclusion FDT is likely to be present in the vast majority of new vehicles in the coming years, in Australia and beyond. To ensure that this technology achieves its intended positive safety outcomes, it is crucial to consider perspectives of its potential users. While the public may appreciate the potential safety benefits, the acceptance and appropriate use of FDT depend on addressing a range of both individual- and system-level fac - tors. Ideally, both FDT manufacturers, and legislative/regulatory bodies would address usability and functionality concerns (e.g., accuracy), in addition to the broader context in which the technology operates. Critically, questions about legal implications and user privacy must be addressed to support the effective adoption of FDT. If these concerns are addressed, the potential safety benefits of FDT for the public could be significant. CRediT authorship contribution statement M.

{"page_content": "How did internet information influence COVID-19 vaccination? The cyclical influence of the internet information, beliefs, attitudes, and intentions toward vaccines from a three-wave longitudinal study Sanae Inoue a, *, Kei Fuji b a University of Tsukuba, Graduate School of Comprehensive Human Sciences, Japan b Faculty of Human Sciences, University of Tsukuba, Japan ABSTRACT This study examined the psychological processes leading to the formation of COVID-19 vaccination in Japan, a country with strong vaccine hesitancy, using inte - grative health behavior theory. We conducted a three-wave longitudinal study of 990 Japanese adults to investigate what information on the internet cyclically influences vaccination attitudes and intentions. The results showed that the psychological process that leads to the acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine can be explained by applying integrative health behavior theory. However, while susceptibility to and fear of infection significantly influenced vaccination intention at the beginning of the pandemic, only the severity of the disease was significant at Time 3, indicating that the factors that promote vaccination intention can change over time. Nevertheless, subjective norms and self-efficacy were consistently associated with COVID-19 vaccination intentions and beliefs throughout the entire period. Furthermore, although information obtained from the internet influences vaccination intention, this influence varies depending on the content. In particular, in - formation on the availability of vaccines increases vaccination intentions, and vaccination intentions facilitate the viewing of information in the next wave, indicating that information gathering on the internet and vaccine attitudes have a cyclical influence. Although expert information reduced self-efficacy and community benefits in the first wave, this effect decreased over time. The findings provide practical insight into how to increase vaccination intentions in the context of information confusion before and after vaccination programs are launched. 1. Introduction In December 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) had spread worldwide, and the World Health Organization (WHO) declared it a pandemic in March 2020. With the rapid spread of the disease and the lack of development and dissemination of therapeutic agents, vaccina - tion was one of the most cost-effective ways to prevent the disease [ 1 ]. Thus, COVID-19 vaccines were developed and approved at an unprec - edented speed. Consequently, the world ’ s first two-dose COVID-19 vaccination program began in the United Kingdom in December 2020, and vaccine coverage subsequently expanded to other countries around the world. However, even before the COVID-19 outbreak, Japan was rated a country with a very high level of “ vaccine hesitancy ” [ 2 ]. Vaccine hes - itancy refers to a delay in accepting or refusing vaccines despite the availability and quality of vaccine services [ 3 ]. Therefore, vaccine hes - itancy is one of the world ’ s greatest health threats [ 4 ]. Japan is considered to have a low level of vaccine confidence, according to a survey conducted in 149 countries between 2015 and 2019 [ 2 ] on vaccination intentions for existing vaccines prior to the COVID-19 vaccine. In Japan, repeated reports of adverse effects from the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine have led to vaccine avoidance, with HPV vaccination rates dropping to less than 1 % [ 5 ]. Although the develop - ment of vaccines began immediately after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, research on the acceptance of new vaccines progressed until these vaccines were implemented [ 6 – 9 ]. Notably, another survey conducted in February 2021, just before COVID-19 vaccination began in Japan, showed that 32.9 % and 11.0 % of respondents answered “ not sure ” or “ no ”, respectively, regarding their intention to be vaccinated against COVID-19 [ 10 ]. In Japan, the government ’ s call for social distancing, which was in place since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, restricted outdoor activities and large group events [ 11 ]. In particular, the declaration of a state of emergency and the implementation of priority measures to prevent the spread of disease, which were issued intermittently from March 2020 to September 2021, required individuals to restrict various movements, including going outside. In this situation, the primary sources of information for the Japanese population shifted to the internet and social media [ 12 ]. The role of social media as a primary source of information has become increasingly prominent, superseding * Corresponding author. 3-29-1 Otsuka, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, Japan.

{"page_content": "its previous status as a secondary medium [ 13 ]. However, it has also been suggested that with the increased use of the internet during the pandemic, highly uncertain information became more widespread [ 14 ]. Side effects and safety concerns were among the main reasons for refusing vaccination [ 15 ], but misinformation was also actively searched for and disseminated through social media [ 16 ]. In Japan, the number of online posts pertaining to vaccines increased on a daily basis, and the dissemination of misinformation was confirmed [ 17 ]. It has been suggested that exposure to a variety of sources of vaccine infor - mation, including social media, may reinforce vaccine hesitancy and influence intentions [ 18 ]. However, the impact of the content of specific internet information on COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy has not yet been examined. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to clarify how infor - mation on the internet influenced vaccination intentions in Japan, where the nationwide level of vaccine hesitancy is very high. 1.1. Vaccine hesitancy and models that explain vaccination intention Historically, the rejection of vaccines has been observed in a variety of countries. This behavior was observed as far back as 1840 in the United Kingdom [ 19 ]. Acceptance of or hesitancy toward vaccines re - sults from a complex decision-making process that involves various factors [ 3, 20 ]. For instance, influenza is one of the most widespread infectious diseases that threatens children, adults, and older adults. A systematic review of factors related to seasonal and pandemic influenza vaccination was conducted on 470 articles published between 2005 and 2016 to examine factors such as psychological processes [ 21 ]. Based on the theory of planned behavior (TPB; Ajzen [ 22 ]), Schmid et al. [ 21 ] showed that a lack of confidence, inconvenience, calculation, and complacency are barriers to influenza vaccine uptake in at-risk groups. Attempts to construct a model of the psychological process preceding vaccination have been conducted since the emergence of the TPB. Ex - amples include the health belief model (HBM [ 23 ]), in which perceived susceptibility and severity, fear, perceived benefits or barriers, and self-efficacy explain behaviors and behavioral intentions. The extended parallel process model (EPPM [ 24 ]) proposes that self-efficacy as well as perceived threat (severity and sensitivity) motivate behavior. These theories of health behavior have been used to explain people ’ s health behaviors [ 25 ]. Some studies have applied these theories to influenza and HPV vaccination, but the elements that constitute the model overlap [ 26 ]. Therefore, an approach that integrates multiple models may pro - vide a solution to this problem. To consolidate previous discussions and apply them to COVID-19 vaccination, Chu and Liu [ 27 ] investigated the psychological process that influences vaccination intentions among Americans. Before the widespread use of the COVID-19 vaccine, three models, the HBM, TPB, and EPPM, were used to provide a comprehensive view of the psycho - logical factors and processes that influence vaccination intentions. The integrative health behavior theory model is outlined below ( Fig. 1 ). Vaccination intention is defined based on COVID-19 risk perception, fear, self-efficacy, and vaccination attitude. Furthermore, attitudes to - ward COVID-19 vaccination are influenced by perceived benefits and barriers. Specifically, psychological and social aspects, such as subjec - tive norms, attitudes toward conventional vaccines, influenza vaccina - tion history, and cues to action, can influence these perceptions. Based on integrative health behavior theory, Chu and Liu [ 27 ] found that these factors determine COVID-19 vaccination intentions, and research on COVID-19 vaccination intentions has been conducted in various countries using this theory. For example, predictors that significantly affect COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in Malaysia include susceptibility, attitude, and subjective norms [ 28 ]. The present study applied this framework to examine the psycho - logical processes that lead to vaccination in Japan. Previous evidence has suggested that the factors included in the HBM can effectively explain COVID-19 vaccination among Japanese people. Machida et al. [ 29 ] indicated that the psychological factors that may lead to Japanese people ’ s decision to vaccinate against COVID-19 are “ susceptibility, ” (i. e., feeling that they are likely to be infected with COVID-19), “ severity, ” (i.e., believing that COVID-19 is a serious disease), “ effectiveness, ” and “ community benefit, ” (i.e., protecting the health of others by vacci - nating themselves). Some studies have reported that “ barriers, ” such as side effects and safety concerns, were cited by more than half of Japa - nese respondents as reasons for COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy [ 15 ]. Therefore, it is useful to apply the HBM framework to predict vaccina - tion intention or", "metadata": {"producer": "Acrobat Distiller 8.1.0 (Windows)", "creator": "Elsevier", "creationdate": "2025-04-26T09:28:56+00:00", "crossmarkdomains[1]": "elsevier.com", "crossmarkmajorversiondate": "2010-04-23", "creationdate--text": "26th April 2025", "elsevierwebpdfspecifications": "7.0.1", "robots": "noindex", "moddate": "2025-04-26T10:22:56+00:00", "author": "Sanae Inoue", "doi": "10.1016/j.techsoc.2024.102776", "title": "How did internet information influence COVID-19 vaccination?

{"page_content": "H1. Integrative health behavior theory can explain the psychological processes that lead to vaccination intention among the Japanese people with regard to the COVID-19 vaccine. Attitudes toward the COVID-19 vaccine are influenced by individual and community benefits and safety concerns, and constitute vaccination intentions, along with severity, susceptibility, fear, and self-efficacy for vaccination. 1.2. Previous studies on internet information and vaccination intentions This study adopted integrative health behavior theory to investigate Japanese people’s level of contact with vaccine information on the internet and whether this contact influences their vaccination intentions. As mentioned above, these health behavior theories have been used in many studies to explain COVID-19 vaccination intention. However, it has been suggested that while these theories apply to existing vaccines, they may not be directly applicable to COVID-19 vaccination [ 30 ]. Therefore, attention should be given to the factors that characterize the recent COVID-19 epidemic. One of these factors is the internet. Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, information about COVID-19 vaccines has spread via the internet [ 18 ]. The internet can help people gather vaccination infor - mation [ 31 ]. However, this does not necessarily include only science-based information; it may also include fake news stories and conspiracy theories, which are particularly prominent on social media [ 18 ] and spread faster than the truth [ 32 ]. In experimental studies, misinformation about COVID-19 vaccines has been shown to decrease vaccination intentions [ 33 ]. Thus, the influence of media information on the intention to receive COVID-19 vaccines has attracted attention, and previous empirical studies have shown that information gathered on the internet influences people’s vaccination intentions. Pires [ 34 ] conducted a systematic re - view and showed that online information provided by experts improves vaccine hesitancy. Roozenbeek et al. [ 35 ] found that susceptibility to misinformation negatively affects people’s willingness to be vaccinated. Some findings from Japan indicate that internet contact resulting in information about the COVID-19 vaccine influences people’s vaccina - tion intentions [ 36 ]. Based on the above discussion, it can be assumed that exposure to information found on the internet can influence people’s vaccination intentions and the underlying psychological factors related to these in - tentions (i.e., various factors included in integrative health behavior theory). Therefore, it is necessary to apply current extensions of the HBM and to update the model in relation to the recent situation by considering trends found on the internet. The importance of this focus is also supported by the fact that in recent years, the use of internet media has become widespread. Furthermore, it has been shown that time spent using the internet on weekdays exceeds time spent watching TV for all ages in Japan [ 37 ]. In the early stages of the pandemic in Japan, both scientifically confirmed and unconfirmed information was disseminated through social media [ 12 ] Previous studies that have examined the impact of internet information have suggested that the content of the information also has a considerable effect. Betsch et al. [ 38 ] explained that 5–10 min of exposure to a website that is critical of vaccination increases the level of vaccine risk perception. Nan and Madden [ 39 ] showed that while exposure to positive blogs has little effect on attitudes toward vaccines, exposure to negative information on blogs makes people more negative toward vaccines. Similar findings have been re - ported for COVID-19 vaccines. Goel and Nelson [ 40 ] investigated the relationship between internet search content and COVID-19 vaccination rates. The authors found that vaccination rates increased as information on the availability of COVID-19 vaccines became more readily available [ 40 ]. It is important to consider information content when examining the social consequences of information exposure during the spread of the COVID-19 epidemic. However, there is little knowledge of the kind of internet information available to Japanese people with regard to vac - cines. In this study, we explore how this information is categorized through exploratory factor analysis and by considering a wide range of questions about the content of the information that Japanese people are exposed to on the internet. We include the factors in Chu and Liu’s [ 27 ] integrative health behavior theory to examine their influence on vaccination intentions. We present the following hypothesis. H2. Information obtained on the internet influences COVID-19 vacci - nation intention and other factors via integrative health behavior the - ory. The direction of influence also depends on the content of the information obtained via the internet. Specifically, positive information about vaccines positively influences vaccination intentions, whereas negative information has a negative influence on these intentions. Previous studies have suggested that the effects of internet-based information on vaccination intentions are not limited to short-term pe - riods. It has been noted that people do not treat different sources of information equally; rather, they tend to selectively connect with only those sources that are favorable to them and consistent with their own beliefs.

It has been noted that people do not treat different sources of information equally; rather, they tend to selectively connect with only those sources that are favorable to them and consistent with their own beliefs. The resulting closed internet space creates “echo chambers” [ 41–43 ] that lead to group polarization, where people exchange opin - ions with others who share similar ideas and further strengthen their own beliefs over time. It has long been noted that users of internet media, especially social media users, tend to aggregate in communities of interest, which fosters reinforcement and confirmation bias [ 44 ]. It has also been argued that this mechanism applies to decision-making about vaccination. For example, people who use social media to follow health-related organizations that promote vaccination are more positive about vaccination [ 45 ]. Furthermore, some findings have indicated that people who oppose vaccination are likely to use the internet more frequently to view similar opinions. These individuals are likely to agree only with their allies and are not interested in listening their opponents’ opinions [ 46 ]. In line with the prediction made in H2, gathering information via the internet not only influences individuals’ intention to receive a COVID-19 vaccine but also determines the information content to which they are subsequently exposed depending on their attitude toward vaccination. The long-term cyclical process by which individuals’ attitudes are reinforced via exposure to information has been theoretically validated [ 47 ]. Therefore, this study also focused on the possibility of cyclical reinforcement and influence of information obtained through internet media and vaccination intention as well as the psychological factors behind this intention in relation to integrative health behavior theory. To examine this long-term effect, we conducted a longitudinal study. Our third hypothesis is as follows. H3.: Encountering information about the COVID-19 vaccine via the internet affects beliefs, attitudes, and vaccination intentions toward the vaccine, and vaccination intentions determine individuals’ subsequent level of contact with information on the internet. Thus, information contact and vaccination intentions are cyclically influential. In other words, information does not unilaterally affect attitudes and intentions; rather, after attitudes and intentions have been formed, they impact people’s level of contact with information gathering. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Participants The respondents were informed in advance that participation was voluntary and that all responses collected would be anonymous and confidential. The participants were not compelled to respond to the survey and were guaranteed the right to withdraw from the study at any time.

The number of fully vaccinated persons at the end of the study (T3) was 88,652,268, accounting for approximately 70.4 % of the Japanese population [ 48 ]. When determining the sample and its size, we considered the following factors: (a) participants should be from different ages, sexes and provinces, and should have different levels of COVID-19 vaccine intention, (b) data collection should be completed within a week due to changes in the day-to-day vaccination situation in Japan, and (c) to use measurement items from prior studies [ 27 ], the sample size had to be the same as that of Chu and Liu [ 27 ]. The Tokyo-based internet research service company Asmarq Co., Ltd. randomly selected potential respondents (n = 933,000) from among its registrants. We recruited people aged 25 – 64 years who resided in Japan. In a screening survey, we excluded healthcare workers, people over 65 years of age and those with underlying diseases who were given priority COVID-19 vaccinations. Furthermore, since vaccination operations differ by prefecture, our panel was structured to provide a distribution similar to the Japanese population with regard to key demographic and geographic variables. We obtained 1000 responses, with 861 respondents participating through the third wave. Three participants provided almost no answers, 4 participants provided inconsistent answers, and 106 participants tested positive for the COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test and/or COVID-19 antibodies. These respondents were removed in accordance with previous studies [ 27 ]. This resulted in a final sample of 748 participants who responded from T1 through T3 to test H1. A flowchart of the subjects in each analysis period is shown in Fig. 2. The average age of the participants was 46.61 years old (SD = 9.95, 375 male and 373 female). The overall demographic characteristics of our sample are presented in Table 1. 2.2. Materials and methods At the beginning of the study, approval was obtained from the ethics committee at the second author ’ s institution. Informed consent was provided online depending on the initial means of recruitment. After the participants read and agreed to informed consent, they were asked to complete the web survey. All questions were presented in random order for each participant. After the participants completed all demographic questions, including age, gender, marital status, and place of residence, they answered questions about their intention to receive the COVID-19 vaccine and vaccination situations. Each participant received a mone - tary reward upon completion of the online survey. Fig. 2. Flowchart of the subjects in each analysis.

{"page_content": "2.3. Measurement 2.3.1. Integrative health behavior theory This study adapted previously validated measurement items from prior studies [ 27 ]. First, measurement items were translated from En - glish into Japanese based on the Professional Society for Health Eco - nomics and Outcomes Research (ISPOR) guidelines [ 49 ]. Responses were obtained using the scale of Chu and Liu [ 27 ], which was developed to examine COVID-19 vaccination intention based on the health behavior theories of the HBM, TPB and TPPM. The survey measured fear of COVID-19, perceived severity of and susceptibility to COVID-19, perceived individual benefits of COVID-19, community benefits of COVID-19, perceived barriers to receiving the COVID-19 vaccine including safety concerns, subjective norms, baseline vaccine hesitancy, including attitudes toward vaccines in general and recent vaccination history, cues to actions, and demographics. Attitudes toward vaccines were captured by using the semantic deferential (SD) method, and other items were rated on a five-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). Although cost concerns were obtained by Chu and Liu [ 27 ], these concerns were excluded from the current analysis because vaccination is publicly funded in Japan, and all Japa - nese people can receive the COVID-19 vaccination for free. In addition, the responses \"Family or close friend passed away due to COVID-19 ″ and \"Someone you knew passed away due to COVID-19 ″ were included in the cues to action (COVID-19 exposure) but were excluded from the ques - tionnaire with the permission of the original author due to their psy - chological invasiveness. 2.3.2. Obtaining information about COVID-19 vaccination on the internet Items on information about COVID-19 vaccination on the internet were developed through the following steps in a preliminary survey. First, an online survey was conducted with 71 working adults (32 male and 39 female) who ranged in age from 22 to 67 years [M = 39.8 years, SD = 11.36] with a focus on COVID-19 information they had viewed on the internet in the previous two months. Second, based on the catego - rization process, 30 categories were created by the first author, who was a pharmacist and graduate student in psychology and a researcher in social psychology. Each item was rated on a five-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (not viewed) to 5 (very well viewed). Furthermore, we created our own items to obtain information available on the internet on the status of COVID-19 infection. Informa - tion about COVID-19 infection status was predicted to influence vari - ables such as COVID-19 risk perception and fear in integrative health behavior theory. We focused on news items related to the number of cases in all of Japan, other regions and abroad and news about celeb - rities who had been infected. As with the vaccine items, the questions were rated on a 5-point Likert scale. To confirm the internal consistency of the four items of information about COVID-19 infection status on the internet, we calculated the Cronbach ’ s alpha coefficients, which were all above the acceptable level: T1 = 0.90 (n = 990) T2 = 89 (n = 921), and T3 = 0.91 (n = 854). 2.3.3. Demographic variables Demographic variables included sex, age and employment. In addi - tion, we asked the respondents about living with individuals older than 65 years or younger than 12 years and whether they lived with a person who took medication. Previous studies in Japan have shown that COVID-19 vaccine refusal and hesitancy are stronger in people who live alone [ 50 ]. Scholars have also observed the influence of living with a person who is at risk of serious illness. 2.4. Common method bias To avoid problems of common method bias (CMB), this study fol - lowed the recommendations of previous literature by implementing preventive and postdetection procedures. These procedures helped us hide construct names, randomize the order of items, and ensure the anonymity of the respondents. In addition, we conducted Harman ’ s single-factor test with explor - atory factor analysis (EFA) to assess CMB. The results showed that the first factor explained 35.50 % of the variance in T1, 37.15 % in T2 and 36.79 % in T3, which did not exceed the recommended threshold of 50 % [ 51 ].

Statistical analyses We used SPSS ver. 27 software (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, United States) to conduct descriptive statistics and exploratory factor analysis (EFA). In addition, confirmatory factor analysis was performed using SPSS Amos version 27.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, United States). To assess the hypothetical structural model, we conducted a covariance structure analysis using the full information maximum likelihood method with R version 4.1.1 ( http://cran.r-project.org/ ). A path model based on the theoretical framework illustrated in Fig. 3 was then esti - mated. Exogenous variables in the model were allowed to covary considering conceptual covariances. Latent integrative health behavior theory constructs without speci - fied directional effects were allowed to covary to account for common method and conceptual covariances. To account for nonnormality, all measurement and path models were analyzed with maximum likelihood estimation with robust standard errors. We used the robust comparative fit index (R-CFI) and the robust root mean square error of approximation (R-RMSEA) to assess the structural model fit. CFI values ≥ 0.90 and RMSEA values in the range of 0.05 – 0.08 were considered to indicate an acceptable fit [ 52 ]. 3. Results Based on the 990 responses that excluded respondents who provided almost no answers or inconsistent answers obtained from T1, explor - atory factor analysis (EFA) was conducted on information obtained from the internet. We conducted confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to test the validity of the results using data from the samples collected at each time point, excluding inconsistent and dishonest respondents, for the T2 sample (n = 921) and the T3 sample (n = 854). Next, based on the 748 responses that excluded subjects with positive PCR results for COVID-19 obtained from T1 to T3, structural equation modeling (SEM) was conducted on the effect of internet information on the psychological variables of integrative health behavior theory. Table 2 shows the descriptive statistics for all study variables. 3.1. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) We conducted exploratory factor analysis for information about COVID-19 vaccination available on the internet. First, the mean and SD in T1 (N = 990) were calculated for each of the 30 items related to in - formation about COVID-19 vaccination available on the internet to check for nonnormality. There were no items that should be excluded. Second, as criteria for determining the number of factors, we also calculated and compared the AIC (1 factor: 1270.51, 2 factor: 602.08, 3 factor: 244.63, 4 factor: 72.18), BIC (1 factor: \u0000 713.06, 2 factor: \u0000 1239.46, 3 factor: \u0000 1459.77, 4factor: － 1499.98), and CAIC (1 factor: \u0000 308.06, 2 factor: \u0000 863.46, 3 factor: \u0000 1111.77, 4 factor: \u0000 1178.98). Since the AIC tends to select a model with a larger number of factors when the sample size is large, we focused on the selection by BIC and CAIC, which take the sample size into account. However, when a 4-fac - tor solution based on BIC and CAIC was attempted, only two items showed sufficient factor loadings (.529 and.474) on the fourth factor, making factor interpretation quite difficult. Given these results as well as interpretability, we concluded that it was appropriate to set the number of factors to 3. The results of EFA (maximum likelihood estimation and S. Inoue and K.

To measure the adequacy of the sample, the Kaiser ‒ Meyer ‒ Olkin (KMO) test was calculated at 0.99, which is greater than the suggested threshold of 0.60 [ 53 ]. Based on the results of the EFA, items with factor loadings below 0.40 and items that showed high factor loadings on more than one factor (all above 0.40) were removed. Through these procedures, 6 items were removed, and 24 items remained. This final solution with three factors spanning 24 items explained 77.0 % of the total variance. The clustering of the items suggested that the first factor contained items that indicated information on expertise in effects (e.g., informa - tion indicating that the vaccine is not effective and problems in the domestic vaccine development process) ( α =.97). The second factor referred to information on availability for individuals (e.g., vaccination timing and scheduling and a time when they might be able to receive the vaccination) ( α =.94). The last factor involved information on national and international dissemination and included eight items, such as the “ rapid spread of vaccines overseas ” and “ vaccination trends overseas ” ( α =.96). To confirm validation, we conducted confirmatory factor analysis using the maximum likelihood method for information about COVID-19 vaccination available on the internet with all data obtained at each period of T2 (n = 921) and T3 (n = 854). The χ 2 and CFI both suggested a good fit of the model [T2; χ 2 (249) = 1370.64 ( p <.001), CFI = 0.954, RMSEA = 0.070 [90 % CI:0.066-0.074)] [T3; χ 2 (249) = 1435.344 ( p <.001), CFI = 0.954, RMSEA = 0.075 [90 % CI:0.071-0.079) ]. Further - more, in both T2 and T3, acceptable values were shown for AVE (in T2 data, F1: 0.69, F2: 0.77, F3: 0.74; in T3 data, F1: 0.75, F2: 0.78, F3: 0.77) and CR (in T2 data, F1: 0.95, F2: 0.92, F3: 0.94; in T3 data, F1: 0.96, F2: 0.92, F3: 0.95) [ 55 ]. Based on these results, we analyzed the addition of these 24 items to the hypothetical model. 3.2. Structural equation modeling (SEM) The result of the covariance structure analysis based on hypothetical model ( Fig. 1 ) suggested an acceptable fit: χ 2 (845) = 3257.33 ( p <.001), R-CFI = 0.920, and R-RMSEA = 0.066 [90 % CI:0.064-0.069]. The CFI measures signified good fit indices. Additionally, the RMSEA mea - sures suggested an acceptable fit index. Thus, the psychological pro - cesses leading to vaccination intention and its formation among Japanese people for the COVID-19 vaccine were explained by integra - tive health behavior theory ( H1 ). The results are shown in Appendix. The results indicated that the three factors related to vaccine infor - mation that was available on the internet influenced each psychological variable at T1. F1 had a negative influence on self-efficacy and perceived benefits, F3 had an influence on individual benefits and safety concerns, and F2 had a positive influence on self-efficacy and perceived commu - nity benefits and a negative influence on safety concerns. At T2, the influence of each factor was weakened, and at T3, only the influence of F2 remained. Furthermore, F2 had a direct positive effect on attitude at all time points, i.e., T1 to T3. In other words, information obtained via the internet had different effects on vaccination intentions depending on the content ( H2 ). In particular, F2, exposure to internet information, influenced psy - chological variables from time T1, leading to vaccination intention. Intention at T1 also influenced F2 exposure at T2. The results for T3 were similar. Thus, with regard to internet information, information about the availability of vaccination (F2) was found to have a cyclically positive effect on vaccination intention ( H3 ).

At T2, the influence of each factor was weakened, and at T3, only the influence of F2 remained. Furthermore, F2 had a direct positive effect on attitude at all time points, i.e., T1 to T3. In other words, information obtained via the internet had different effects on vaccination intentions depending on the content ( H2 ). In particular, F2, exposure to internet information, influenced psy - chological variables from time T1, leading to vaccination intention. Intention at T1 also influenced F2 exposure at T2. The results for T3 were similar. Thus, with regard to internet information, information about the availability of vaccination (F2) was found to have a cyclically positive effect on vaccination intention ( H3 ). Fig. 4 shows only the variables related to internet information. 4. Discussion We examined how information about the COVID-19 vaccine that is available on the internet affects vaccination intention and behavior based on integrative health behavior theory [ 27 ] by conducting a lon - gitudinal study among Japanese people, who have low confidence in vaccines and tend to be hesitant to be vaccinated [ 2, 5 ]. This study provides important findings based on three hypotheses. 4.1. Psychological processes leading to the formation of vaccination intentions in COVID-19 First, we found that by applying the integrated health behavior theory proposed by Chu and Liu [ 27 ], it is possible to explain not only the psychological process that leads to the formation of the intention to receive vaccinations but also vaccination behavior two months later. The results obtained from this study support H1 and suggest that inte - grative health behavior theory can explain the psychological processes that lead to the formation of vaccination intention for the COVID-19 vaccine even in Japanese people. Japanese people were found to have a high level of vaccine hesitancy before the COVID-19 pandemic [ 5 ], and some findings indicate that this tendency was similar during the pandemic. Prior to the implementation of vaccination programs, experimental research on hypothetical vaccines revealed obstacles to the evaluation of their effectiveness and concerns regarding their safety [ 9 ]. Additionally, survey research indicated that the perceived suscep - tibility to infection, the perceived severity of the disease, and the perceived community benefit of vaccination influence individuals ’ Table 2 Descriptive statistics and reliability coefficient of the survey (Scale: Min 1 to Max 5).

{"page_content": "intentions to receive the COVID-19 vaccine [ 29 ]. The findings of this study are meaningful because they correspond to the results of previous studies and indicate that the integrated health behavior model is a useful framework for explaining vaccination even in Japan, where vaccine hesitancy is stronger than in other countries. Moreover, this study provides new findings based on a three-wave longitudinal study. First, this study showed that among the factors of the integrative health behavior model that impact the intention to receive the COVID-19 vaccine, some factors change depending on the period. This was observed especially with regard to risk perception and emotional responses regarding COVID-19 infection. Although suscepti - bility influenced vaccination intention and fear lowered vaccination behavior at T1, immediately after the start of the general vaccination program, only fear continued to have a significant effect on vaccination intention at T2. At 4 months after the start of the vaccination program (T3), there was a weak significant effect of severity. These findings align with previous studies showing that the impact of each factor on health behavior changed between periods during the COVID-19 pandemic [ 56, 57 ]. Furthermore, a systematic review of studies conducted in the period around T1 of this study suggested that susceptibility was associated with vaccination intentions [ 58 ]. Notably, the present study showed similar findings. However, at T1, fear of COVID-19 inhibited vaccination behavior. This result may be related to the situation in Japan in 2021, when individuals and employers were intermittently requested to refrain from unnecessary activities and outings throughout the country to reduce the risk of infection. At the same time, there were long lines at Table 3 Types of information about COVID-19 vaccination available on the internet.[ 54 ] S. Inoue and K.

Under these circumstances, a strong fear of the virus may have increased people ’ s desire to avoid the possibility of infection and to avoid being vaccinated in large groups. However, at T2, the Delta strain, which was feared to cause severe illness, was prevalent [ 61 ]. Fear of this version of the virus that carried a high risk of severe disease may have been the driving factor behind vaccination intentions.

{"page_content": "restrictions ceased, and the resumption of economic activities was emphasized [ 62 ]. In other words, societal trends at that time were moving toward a return to pre-pandemic daily life while taking into consideration the possibility of COVID-19 infection. Under these cir - cumstances, only the severity of COVID-19 may have influenced vacci - nation intentions during this period since there was widespread awareness of the need to avoid severe symptoms rather than fear and avoidance of COVID-19 infection itself. Thus, the results of this study indicate that changes in circumstances in society can affect individuals’ vaccination intention, but the psychological mechanisms involved change from time to time. In other words, this study also demonstrates that integrative health behavior theory is useful in examining how psychological processes that influence vaccination intentions change in response to changes in social context over time. Second, this study reveals the existence of factors that continue to influence COVID-19 vaccination intention despite changes in the social context. In this study, subjective norms impacted individual and com - munity benefits at all time points, strengthened positive attitudes to - ward vaccines, and increased self-efficacy to vaccinate. This finding corresponds with a meta-analysis of studies conducted prior to the COVID-19 pandemic that found that subjective norms and behavioral efficacy had a strong effect on vaccination [ 63 ]. Additionally, throughout the entire period, safety concerns had a negative impact on vaccination attitudes and reduced vaccination intentions. It has been noted that Japanese people have strong concerns about the safety of vaccines [ 2, 15, 50, 64 ], and this finding is consistent among previous studies. This study found that these factors, which have shown strong effects in previous studies, were also found to be influential in the new context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Among the variables included in integrative health behavior theory, cognitive and emotional responses to viruses may change with social contexts, but beliefs about vaccines themselves, such as norm consciousness, self-efficacy, and safety con - cerns, may be less affected by a change of situation. Similar to the findings of Chu and Liu [ 27 ], this study revealed that integrative health behavior theory is an effective model for explaining vaccination intentions. Furthermore, this longitudinal study is the first to show that some factors that determine vaccination intentions change under the influence of social and environmental conditions, while others do not. The findings of this study can be used to understand the psy - chological processes involved in COVID-19 vaccination intentions in Japan. Integrative health behavior theory also has the potential to provide a useful framework for examining aversion to the HPV vaccine, which currently has a low vaccination rate in Japan, as well as vaccines against unknown viruses that may emerge in the future. 4.2. Influence of internet information on vaccination intentions and beliefs about the COVID-19 vaccine The results of this examination of vaccination intentions found that information about COVID-19 vaccination available on the internet also influences COVID-19 vaccination attitudes and intentions. It has been shown that internet information influences intentions and that this in - fluence depends on the content of the information [ 38–40 ], consistent with the findings of previous studies. In the present study, the results of the factor analysis showed that information obtained from the internet about the COVID-19 vaccine was classified into three categories. Among these categories, we found that information on the availability of COVID-19 vaccination influenced self- efficacy and COVID-19 vaccination attitudes and increased the intention to vaccinate at all time points (T1-T3). These results are consistent with the finding that obtaining information about the availability and schedule of vaccination increases vaccination intention [ 40,65,66 ] as well as the results of a meta-analysis showing that self-efficacy, the feeling that one can control one’s own vaccination behavior, promotes vaccination intentions [ 63 ]. In particular, it has been noted that Japa - nese people are afraid of the unknown and tend to take action to avoid uncertainty [ 67 ]. Therefore, information on availability, which can reduce uncertainty about vaccines, may play an important role for Japanese people. However, expertise information was found to have different effects. In the early period (T1), this information was found to lower self- efficacy and perceived benefits. However, this effect eventually faded, and after four months (T3), no significant effect was found. Expertise information is disseminated to provide relief in making vaccination decisions and is thought to have a positive influence on vaccination intentions. Why does it have a negative function? Experts usually explain both positive information, such as efficacy, and negative infor - mation, such as side effects, based on scientific evidence. However, it has been suggested that people are more likely to focus on the negative, and negative information tends to exhibit more power and contagion than positive information [ 68, 69 ]. It is possible that this effect was particularly enhanced in the early stages of the pandemic, when many people lacked knowledge about the", "metadata": {"producer": "Acrobat Distiller 8.1.0 (Windows)", "creator": "Elsevier", "creationdate": "2025-04-26T09:28:56+00:00", "crossmarkdomains[1]": "elsevier.com", "crossmarkmajorversiondate": "2010-04-23", "creationdate--text": "26th April 2025", "elsevierwebpdfspecifications": "7.0.1", "robots": "noindex", "moddate": "2025-04-26T10:22:56+00:00", "author": "Sanae Inoue", "doi": "10.1016/j.techsoc.2024.102776", "title": "How did internet information influence COVID-19 vaccination?

It is possible that this effect was particularly enhanced in the early stages of the pandemic, when many people lacked knowledge about the COVID-19 vaccine and when detailed information, both positive and negative, was more readily available in the media. It is interesting to note that individuals’ decision to vaccinate are influenced not only by domestic information about the vaccine itself but also by information about the development and dissemination of the vaccine at the global level. Since the development and approval process for the COVID-19 vaccine was rapid, some studies have suggested that this perception of exceptional speed may have generated serious con - cerns [ 70 ]. Therefore, it is likely that the Japanese, who are sensitive to uncertainty, perceived the vaccine as being imported to Japan without sufficient safety assessment in other countries. This may have increased Japanese people’s safety concerns [ 15, 50, 64 ], reduced their perceived benefit, and negatively impacted their perception of the vaccine. In summary, internet information influences beliefs and intentions toward the COVID-19 vaccine. However, the influence differs depending on the information. This result supports H2. Information on availability had a consistent positive influence on vaccination intentions, while expertise information and information on foreign approval had a negative impact at certain times. This result implies that changes in the social context can play a crucial role, similar to the findings from the examination of H1. Therefore, the results also suggest that information on availability that has a positive impact regardless of the time of year should be disseminated consistently regardless of social conditions. In contrast, expertise information that may have a negative impact should be disseminated cautiously and with careful consideration, especially during the start of a pandemic. 4.3. Cyclical influence of vaccination intentions and internet information on COVID-19 vaccine This study showed that information gathered from the internet and individuals’ beliefs affect each other similar to an echo chamber. Spe - cifically, increased vaccination intention encourages people to seek in - formation on availability via the internet. Moreover, exposure to this information increases beliefs and intentions in favor of vaccination. This process of reciprocal influence was observed from T1 to T3. Based on these findings, H3 is supported. These results are consistent with pre- COVID-19 pandemic theories of information-seeking behavior and the cyclical influence of attitudes [ 47 ], confirmation bias to obtain positive internet information related to positive vaccine beliefs [ 71 ], and atti - tudes and beliefs that govern the collection of health information online [ 72 ]. In addition, vaccines are a controversial topic that is susceptible to the echo chamber effect [ 42 ]. This study demonstrates that previous theory is equally applicable in the unprecedented situation of the COVID-19 pandemic and provides new empirical findings that extend the theory through an examination of the cyclical influence of positive beliefs about vaccines and information on availability. This cyclical in - fluence depends on the content of the information, similar to the find - ings from the examination of H2. S. Inoue and K.

{"page_content": "However, this study also showed for the first time that this cyclical influence, like an echo chamber, weakens over time. It has been observed that information seeking is more active during periods of extreme interest, such as the early stages of a pandemic as in T1, and during periods of high uncertainty when there is insufficient information to support decision-making [ 73, 74 ]. However, after T2, information on vaccination was being disseminated by local governments in Japan, and vaccination coupons were delivered to all people. People were increas - ingly reassured as others around them were vaccinated and as they gained experience with vaccination. Therefore, it is possible that as people progressed from T2 to T3, they may have been less strongly motivated to search for information, and the coefficient value may have decreased. In summary, this study revealed the important empirical finding that not all types of information produce a reciprocal influence process, nor do they continue to be selected and influenced as social contexts change over time. Therefore, this study provides new insights into existing theories on the need to consider both the content and timing of vacci - nation information depending on the beliefs and attitudes already held by the public. 4.4. Practical implications The results of this study provide practical suggestions for promoting vaccination programs during the COVID-19 pandemic. It is necessary to implement interventions and measures that take into account both the psychological process of vaccination, as indicated by integrated health behavior theory, and the social context. In particular, as shown in the present study, because cognitive and emotional responses to the virus are likely to change depending on the infection situation and social conditions, the implementation of different interventions and measures and switching between them at different times is likely to be effective. However, given that subjective norms and self-efficacy show consistent effects regardless of the social context, it may be effective to implement interventions and measures that communicate the effectiveness of vac - cines and focus on these factors. The influence of information that people may access on the internet is also important in combating vaccine hesitancy. This study suggests that Japanese people, who strongly desire to avoid uncertainty amid the global scientific uncertainty of a pandemic, could overcome vaccine hesitancy if they have specific information on availability for in - dividuals, such as when, where, and for whom vaccinations are avail - able. As suggested by Phillip et al. [ 75 ], developing a digital strategy that provides information that is tailored to each individual’s specific situation and is useful to the individual, in collaboration with local governments and medical institutions, would make a tremendous contribution to promoting vaccination. Similarly, the actions of health care providers, such as pharmacists, who can communicate in a familiar manner and provide specific information to individuals may also be effective in promoting vaccination. In fact, studies during the pandemic showed that working with pharmacists, who are accessible to the gen - eral public, have long been a source of information about vaccination and other public health activities, and are central to the local commu - nity, is also effective [ 76, 77 ]. Pharmacists’ ability to provide specific information is promising. Caution is necessary, however, when considering that expertise in the effects of vaccination and information on the dissemination of vac - cines outside the country may lead to negative attitudes in the early stages of primary vaccination, when vaccine information is lacking. Furthermore, it is important to note that during a pandemic, information disseminated by experts has various influences, and accurate informa - tion is required amid scientific uncertainty [ 78,79 ]. In such a situation, it is increasingly important for science communicators to disseminate to the public not only negative information on effects but also positive information in an easily understood manner while effectively explaining information on availability [ 78 ]. Furthermore, while exposure to a variety of types of digital media information has been shown to influ - ence perceptions of vaccine efficacy [ 80 ], it would be useful to educate people on how to gather a wide range of information rather than relying on exposure to information from specific experts. It is also important to understand that the impact of the information gathering discussed in this study is a cyclical process of influence that is driven by pre-existing attitudes, including people’s own vaccination experience. In line with the findings of this study, it would be beneficial to provide consistent information to promote vaccination behavior and on an ongoing basis after vaccination given the cyclical influence of pre- existing attitudes and information. Furthermore, the provision of in - formation on availability that does not undermine the echo chambers that support positive attitudes toward vaccines and vaccination in - tentions can promote stable vaccination behavior and is expected to be effective in preventing dropouts from vaccination programs that require multiple doses. The combination of these approaches suggested by this study may help to reduce the reluctance to use newly developed vaccines in countries that, like Japan, are reluctant to vaccinate. These approaches can also minimize the threat of further unknown pandemics in the future, should they", "metadata": {"producer": "Acrobat Distiller 8.1.0 (Windows)", "creator": "Elsevier", "creationdate": "2025-04-26T09:28:56+00:00", "crossmarkdomains[1]": "elsevier.com", "crossmarkmajorversiondate": "2010-04-23", "creationdate--text": "26th April 2025", "elsevierwebpdfspecifications": "7.0.1", "robots": "noindex", "moddate": "2025-04-26T10:22:56+00:00", "author": "Sanae Inoue", "doi": "10.1016/j.techsoc.2024.102776", "title": "How did internet information influence COVID-19 vaccination?

It is also important to understand that the impact of the information gathering discussed in this study is a cyclical process of influence that is driven by pre-existing attitudes, including people’s own vaccination experience. In line with the findings of this study, it would be beneficial to provide consistent information to promote vaccination behavior and on an ongoing basis after vaccination given the cyclical influence of pre- existing attitudes and information. Furthermore, the provision of in - formation on availability that does not undermine the echo chambers that support positive attitudes toward vaccines and vaccination in - tentions can promote stable vaccination behavior and is expected to be effective in preventing dropouts from vaccination programs that require multiple doses. The combination of these approaches suggested by this study may help to reduce the reluctance to use newly developed vaccines in countries that, like Japan, are reluctant to vaccinate. These approaches can also minimize the threat of further unknown pandemics in the future, should they occur. 4.5. Limitations and future study This study has several limitations. First, this study was conducted only in Japan. Thus, further development and generalization of the model is required for validation and confirmation in other countries with various levels of pandemic experience. Second, the amount of in - formation obtained from the internet was assessed subjectively by each respondent. Even when the respondents were asked what kind of in - formation made a strong impression on them, it was unclear to what extent and how they were objectively exposed to each type of infor - mation. In the future, a more detailed verification process will be necessary, including the use of actual internet access records. Third, as the results of this study indicate, vaccination intentions should be examined in more detail to understand how they are influenced by changes in public health with regard to infection, information dissemi - nation, and a wide range of social factors. Thus, the continued moni - toring of vaccination coverage, attitudes, and intentions is needed. 5. Conclusion As expectations for the spread of the vaccine increased during the COVID-19 pandemic, people were exposed to a variety of information on the internet. This study applied integrative health behavior theory to determine how information on the internet influences the process of forming vaccination intentions. The results of this longitudinal study allowed us to explain vaccination intentions based on integrative health behavior theory. We found that perceptions of the virus changed with the social context, while the effects of subjective norms, self-efficacy, and safety concerns remained unchanged. Furthermore, while all in - formation influenced beliefs at a time when information was scarce, information on availability for individuals continued to have a positive effect in the process of vaccine dissemination. This occurred through a cyclical effect, similar to an echo chamber, with information influencing beliefs about vaccines and vice versa. On the other hand, expert infor - mation on the effects of the vaccine outside of the country was found to negatively affect vaccination intentions. The effects varied according to the content of the information and as the timing of the information changed. The results of this study suggest that although information disseminated by experts does not necessarily have a positive effect, exposure to information on vaccine availability from the early stages may reduce individuals’ anxiety about vaccines and lead to confidence in vaccination, even among Japanese people who have strong vaccine hesitancy.

{"page_content": "Impact of national university patenting on innovation: Researcher analysis in Japan ☆ Kazuyuki Motohashi a, *, Kenta Ikeuchi b, Seokbeom Kwon c a RIETI, University of Tokyo, Japan b RIETI, Japan c Sungkyunkwan University, South Korea ARTICLE INFO JEL classification: O34 O38 Keywords: National university reform University patent University industry collaboration ABSTRACT This study addresses the impact of national university ownership of patents on the quantity and quality of university patents. We constructed researcher-level patent data with detailed information on their affiliations, and the difference-in-differences (DID) model was applied to determine the change in patent characteristics of national university researchers when the institutional ownership of intellectual property rights at national universities was allowed in 2004. An increase in university patenting has a significant impact on subsequent innovation, as observed by its forward citation, particularly by firms without prior university collaborations. 1. Introduction The impact of patenting on university research on science and technology knowledge spillovers is a long-standing controversy. Whether patenting of university research hinders or facilitates knowl - edge spillover to subsequent research and industrial applications is at the heart of this debate. Some studies have demonstrated that the anticommons nature of university patenting hinders knowledge spill - over from university research activities ([ 1 ]; Fabrizino, 2007; [ 2 ]). However, a positive impact of university patenting on innovation has been demonstrated by requiring university scientists to disclose the details of their findings [ 3 ] and encouraging firms to engage in follow-on innovation [ 4 – 6 ]. The impact of university patenting on subsequent innovations is determined by the balance between the patenting propriety nature (negative) and the information disclosure effect (positive); thus, empirical results are influenced by the scientific field. In addition, the national institutional setting, including the university system ’ s gover - nance mechanism and academic patenting policy, also matters in empirical findings. Mowrey and Sampat [ 7 ] described the significant institutional differences between the United States (US) and continental European countries. This study addresses this issue by examining the incorporation of national universities in Japan in 2004 to identify the marginal effect of university patenting. This reform involves the incorporation of national universities in Japan as independent entities transformed from govern - ment organizations under the Ministry of Education. Such organiza - tional change allows national universities to patent their discoveries as independent legal entities [ 8 ]. However, this policy did not affect Ja - pan ’ s private and local government-affiliated universities, in which patenting was allowed as an institution even before this reform. Therefore, this institutional reform provides us an opportunity to eval - uate the marginal impact of university patenting (before and after the reform) in different settings (national vs. nonnational universities). In this study, we created a unique dataset by linking disambiguated patent inventors and research paper authors at the researcher level, covering all science disciplines. Controlling researcher-level heteroge - neity across capability and discipline, this study complements past empirical studies with mixed results. Additionally, we contribute to the understanding of the relationship between university patenting and knowledge spillovers in Japan by adding more geographic contexts, whereas almost all past studies dealt with US or European cases. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 in - troduces previous studies on patent applications and examines ☆ This study is conducted as a part of the Project “ Digitalization and Innovation Ecosystem: Holistic Approach ” undertaken at the Research Institute of Economy, Trade, and Industry (RIETI).

{"page_content": "qualitative changes in patents and inventions in the context of institu - tional ownership of university patents. Section 3 describes the method of extracting patents held by university faculty members from the database employed, specifically the IIP Patent based on published patent appli - cations of the Japan Patent Office. Section 4 presents the results of the quantitative analysis of the impact of the national university corporation reform on university patents. Finally, Section 5 summarizes the policy implications and presents issues for future research. 2. Literature review and position of the current study Concerns that patenting university research outcomes may hinder subsequent scientific inquiry and industrial applications have been well conceptualized by the “Tragedy of the Anticommons” [ 9, 10 ]. Several studies have provided supportive evidence. For example, Henderson et al. [ 11 ] demonstrated that the propensity of university patents to be cited by patents in diverse technical fields has been declining since the mid-1980s because of the Bayh–Dole Act of 1980. Additionally, the attribution of research findings funded by public research funds to universities has led to an increase in the number of university patents but a decline in their quality. This finding implies that university ownership of patents derived from government-funded research may restrict knowledge spillover while generating economically less valuable patents. Murray and Stern [ 1 ] investigated the impact of patenting on sci - entific research. Analyzing 169 patent–paper pairs, they found a decline of approximately 10%–20 % in the research paper citations after the patent on scientific research was granted, indicating a potential slowing down of knowledge spillover to subsequent research. This study directly tested the tragedy of the anticommons hypothesis, providing an empirical foundation for further discussion about the impact of uni - versity patenting in science. It also called for studies on how university patenting may affect industrial innovation. Chaves et al. (2023) confirmed a similar pattern in the Chilean context, demonstrating that university patenting hinders open science through publication delays and refusal to share research. Fabrizio [ 12 ] attempted to respond to this call by analyzing the relationship between university patenting and the pace of industrial innovation development using patent citation information. The analysis demonstrated that as university patenting increases, the lag in creating a firm-patented invention becomes longer. This pattern was particularly strong in fields where scientific knowledge is the key input for firm innovation. The findings imply that university patenting may slow down knowledge spillover from university research to industry, resulting in a deceleration of industrial innovation. The two studies summarized above revealed that university patenting may deter knowledge diffusion not only to science but also to industry, supporting concerns about the undesirable impacts of university patenting on innovation. However, other research strands have found somewhat inconsistent or even opposite evidence to this conclusion, arguing that university patenting may facilitate both scientific and technological progress because of the information disclosure function of patenting. This func - tion incentivizes university researchers to explore industrial applica - tions more actively while enhancing the impact of university research [ 3, 13–15 ]. Various pieces of evidence support this view. For example, using the same data as those of Henderson et al., Mowery and Ziedonis [ 16 ] found that universities with a higher concentration of patents had an increased number of citations, whereas the number of citations decreased in uni - versities with fewer patents after the Bayh–Dole Act in the US. This in - dicates that the impact of university patenting on industrial spillovers of university research varies by institution. Shane [ 5 ] offered more contextualized evidence supporting Mowery and Ziedonis’ [ 16 ] conclusion. By analyzing patents assigned to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, this study demonstrated that university inventions with effective patent protections are more frequently licensed to firms. This implies that university patenting may help promote knowledge spillovers to industry from university re - searchers. Although the generalizability of this finding is limited, as it was based only on the case of one academic institution, the findings imply that the relationship between university patenting and industrial innovation through knowledge spillover is likely more complicated than prior theoretical discussions have indicated. Magerman et al. [ 17 ] analyzed patent–paper pairs to examine whether patenting scientific findings deter scientific and technological spillovers in biotechnology. In contrast to the findings of Murray and Stern [ 1 ], they found no evidence of a negative impact of patenting scientific research on scientific knowledge spillover.

{"page_content": "from university re - searchers. Although the generalizability of this finding is limited, as it was based only on the case of one academic institution, the findings imply that the relationship between university patenting and industrial innovation through knowledge spillover is likely more complicated than prior theoretical discussions have indicated. Magerman et al. [ 17 ] analyzed patent–paper pairs to examine whether patenting scientific findings deter scientific and technological spillovers in biotechnology. In contrast to the findings of Murray and Stern [ 1 ], they found no evidence of a negative impact of patenting scientific research on scientific knowledge spillover. Sampat and Williams [ 6 ] extended this investigation by examining whether patenting gene research deters follow-up scientific research and the development of gene-based pharmaceutical products in the US. They found that follow-on research was more significant for patented genes than for nonpatented genes, indicating a systematic “selection” in gene patenting. Considering the selection, their further analysis found no evidence that gene patenting discouraged follow-on innovation. These findings imply that even in science-driven domains, such as gene-based research and pharmaceutical product development, patenting scientific research outcomes may not uniformly discourage the development of industrial applications. The authors revealed that researchers’ selection of research findings for patenting may further complicate our under - standing of the relationship between patenting science and industrial innovation. In the context of university research and patenting, this implies that university researchers may selectively patent their research, thus making the impacts of university patenting on industrial innovation ambiguous. Researchers have also elaborated on the relationship between uni - versity patenting and industrial innovation by examining the channels of knowledge spillover from university to industry and the role of univer - sity “ownership” of patented research. Scholars in Europe have made significant contributions to this field by examining the impact of insti - tutional changes that enable universities to own patents from university researchers. For example, Lissoni et al. [ 18 ] explored how institutional changes that introduced the “professor’s privilege” while expanding the autonomy of universities’ management affected university patenting activities in Italy. Using European patent data, the researchers found that these changes resulted in a significant increase in university pat - enting mainly because universities established rules to override pro - fessors’ privileges to secure their ownership of faculty inventions. This finding implies that institutional changes granting universities auton - omy over their intellectual property rights (IPRs) may encourage their patenting activities by enabling them to develop internal rules to control university researchers’ patent ownership. Schoen and Buenstorf [ 19 ] reached a similar conclusion by providing evidence of a significant increase in university-owned patents after the abolition of the professor’s privilege. These two studies revealed that institutional changes that enable universities to own their patents result in a substantial increase in the number of university patents. Other scholars have examined how such institutional changes affect the spillover of university research. For instance, Giuri et al. [ 4 ] exam - ined how universities’ patent ownership is associated with the commercialization of university research using data on over 800 patents owned by universities or public research organizations and filed with the European Patent Office in 22 countries. Their analysis revealed that universities’ patent ownership is positively associated with the likeli - hood of the patent being licensed. This reveals that university patent ownership facilitates the channel for the commercialization of univer - sity knowledge, at least through patent licensing. In the European re - gion, Caviggioli et al. [ 20 ] established the pattern of technology specialization via university patenting. As patent licensing is one of the major channels for transforming university research into industrial applications, Callaert et al. [ 21 ] examined whether policies encouraging university patenting deteriorate K. Motohashi et al.

{"page_content": "the technological spillover of university knowledge and whether this effect differs by patent ownership (i.e., owned by university or firm). Using data on the patenting activities of Flemish universities from 1991 to 2001, their analysis revealed that policies encouraging university patenting have led to a substantial increase in university involvement in patenting their research. Interestingly, the study found no evidence of worsened technological spillover of university knowledge due to pat - enting. Their findings demonstrated that encouraging university pat - enting (ownership) through policy changes does not necessarily result in aggravation of the tragedy of the anticommons. Martínez and Sterzi [ 2 ] explored a more complex relationship be - tween university patent ownership and spillover by examining the change in technological spillovers after the abolition of the professor ’ s privilege in Europe. Their analysis revealed that after universities began owning faculty patents, the size of the technological spillover of aca - demic patents declined (measured by patent forward citations), whereas when firms owned university patents, the spillover increased signifi - cantly. Ljungberg et al. [ 22 ] further elaborated by comparing the dif - ference in forward patent citations between academic patents owned by Swedish firms and firm-invented patents. The authors examined whether the size of technological spillovers differed based on the origin of firm patents (i.e., academic or non-academic). Their analysis revealed that the short-term technological spillover of academic patents owned by universities was smaller than that of firm-owned academic patents. However, this difference eventually disappeared. The complication was further highlighted by Penin [ 23 ], who demonstrated that university patenting is positively associated with the size of knowledge spillover to industry, and may induce university sci - entists ’ strategic behavior in publication. By analyzing survey data on 280 French academic inventors, the author revealed that university patenting accelerates the transfer of university technology to industry while delaying the publication of scientific discoveries. The positive spillover effect of university collaboration on firms is also confirmed in the Chinese context [ 24 ]. Table 1 summarizes our literature review. Although the studies summarized above have contributed to extending our understanding of the relationship between university patenting and knowledge spillover, they also revealed notable empirical irregularities stemming from various contexts in which university pat - enting occurs. Specifically, the empirical settings of these studies vary in terms of geographical context, being predominantly concentrated in the US and Europe. As regions and countries have distinctive characteristics in their local innovation systems, knowledge spillovers from science to technology and their relationship with university patenting may vary by region, which may explain why the evidence in the US is not consistent with what has been observed in Europe. This underscores the impor - tance of further empirical studies in more diverse regional contexts, such as Asia. Motohashi and Muramatsu (2010) and Kwon et al. [ 25 ] responded to this call. Motohashi and Muramatsu (2010) analyzed the changes in the quality of industry – academia collaboration patents in Japan before and after 2000, as Japan introduced the Bayh – Dole-like act in 1999. They analyzed the impact of a series of industry – academia collaboration policies, including the Technology Licensing Organization (TLO) Act in 1998, the enforcement of the Japanese version of the Bayh – Dole Act in 1999, and the reform of national corporations in 2004, in terms of changes in the characteristics of patents held by universities, including private universities, compared with those held by corporations. Their results revealed the effectiveness of the industry – academia collabora - tion policy regarding the number and quality of patents since 2000 ac - cording to the generality index, which measures the diversification of technology classes of cited patents. However, an analysis from the perspective of the partner companies in industry – academia collabora - tions indicated a tendency for companies to make more significant in - ventions independently.

{"page_content": "patent rights. The study by Motohashi and Muramatsu (2010) was helpful in empirically examining how one channel of diffusing univer - sity knowledge to industry (i.e., university–industry collaboration) is possibly shaped by the institutional change that enabled and encouraged university patenting in Japan. A more recent study by Kwon et al. [ 25 ] analyzed the case of the national university reform in Japan in 2004 and revealed that institu - tional changes encouraging universities to explore the commercial po - tential of their research outcomes, including enabling university patenting, did not have a negative impact on the research productivity of university scientists or scientific knowledge spillovers. By investigating how the institutional change encouraging the commercial use of uni - versity knowledge, including enabling university patent ownership in Asia, affects their scientists’ research activities, it hints at how university patenting (more broadly strengthening academic entrepreneurship) shapes the scientific and technological endeavor of academic scientists. Although Kwon et al. [ 25 ] partially answered the question of how such institutional change encouraging university patenting impacted the spillover of university “knowledge” to industry, the questions of how it shaped the spillover of university “inventions” to industry and whether university patent ownership of research outcome indeed spurs diffusion of university inventions to industry and in what mechanism are unanswered. In the next section, we describe our empirical strategy to explore the answers to these questions by examining the relationship between institutionally enabled patenting of university research and knowledge spillover in Japan. 3. Research context: National university reforms in Japan In April 2004, the national university reform transformed indepen - dent higher education entities into national university corporations, which had previously been part of the national government’s adminis - trative structure. The corporations were granted administrative auton - omy, including fund allocation and personnel management. Each corporation was required to establish its own mid-term goals and plans for six years and manage itself according to its objectives, whereby institutional funding was allocated based on performance evaluations. In addition to education and research, universities were assigned a third mission of contributing to society by commercializing research outputs. Government funding was reduced by a certain percentage, and more budget was allocated to competitive funding projects to encourage research competition among universities [ 8, 25 ]. Since the establishment of independent administrative agencies for each university in 2004, universities have claimed their own IPRs instead of being considered government entities; thus, national univer - sity corporations file applications and register for IPRs. The University Intellectual Property Office Creation Program was launched in 2003 to support the development of a strategic system for universities’ creation, acquisition, management, and use of intellectual property (IP). This program provides grants to universities and public research institutes, including national universities. Furthermore, as the Japanese version of the Bayh–Dole Act was enacted in 1999, it allowed institutions that fund their research with government funds to attribute the resulting patents to themselves. There have been a growth in patents resulting from industry–academia collaborations due to measures to support such collaboration, starting with the TLO Act in 1998 [ 8 ]. In principle, patents filed by faculty members of national universities before the incorporation system in 2004 were attributed to the faculty member responsible for the invention under the “principle of individual attribution.” Regarding inventions resulting from university–industry collaboration, patents were usually applied for solely by the company funding the research as compensation or by the academic inventor involved in the joint project. As an exception, the head of the university may act as the applicant if the research was funded by special govern - ment measures or conducted using special large-scale research equipment installed for research purposes by the government [ 26 ]. The number of patent applications from national university corpo - rations has increased rapidly since 2004 due to universities’ authoriza - tion of institutional ownership. The case studies of patent applications and their management at the University of Tsukuba, Hiroshima Uni - versity, and Tohoku University [ 27 ] provide a detailed analysis of in - dividual universities. The experiences of the three national universities in Japan indicate that a sharp increase in patent applications is driven by internal systems, such as creating an IP office, supported by the Uni - versity Intellectual Property Headquarters Development Program Min - istry funded by the government. Despite the lack of patenting by national universities before this re - form, these universities have been actively engaged in research collab - orations with private firms [ 28 ]. The firms applied for patents from such activities because the national university was not an independent legal entity that could claim its patent rights. A university professor can jointly claim her rights with the collaborating firm as a joint patent application; however, such cases are rare [ 8 ]. 4.

Dataset In this study, we use the inventor disambiguation results [ 29 ], that is, the identification of the same person across all Japan Patent Office (JPO) patents published until 2017 (IIP Patent Database, Goto and Motohashi, 2017), to construct researcher-level data on invention patents to investigate the impact of national university reform in 2004 on patent quality and its spillover effects. The affiliation of the inventor is esti - mated by comparing the inventor’s address with that of the applicant(s) of the patent. For patents involving a university professor as the inventor but in which a firm is the applicant, the professor’s affiliation cannot be identified. However, if the professor holds a patent after the university reform, she can be identified as a university inventor (via an address match). As these two patents belong to the same inventor, the former can be identified as a university–industry joint invention patent with a firm solo application. If the inventor’s affiliate is not a national university, her affiliation can be identified based on the applicant information for each patent, regardless of the timing of the national university reform. We identify “joint invention patent” as an academic patent involving a university professor in invention activities but owned solely by in - dustry (mainly before national university incorporation). In contrast, “joint application patent” is when both the university and firm are identified as applicants [ 8 ]. Fig. 1 depicts the trend of both patents by type of university (national vs. nonnational), indicating that the joint invention patents for national universities were replaced by joint application patents after the incorporation of the national university system in 2004. Interestingly, joint invention patents can be found in nonnational universities as well since institutional ownership of patents was not strongly implemented at private or local government univer - sities in the 1990s. However, the shift from joint inventions to joint applications occurred slowly for nonnational universities, in contrast to national universities where a more abrupt change was found, driven by the institutional reform in 2004. Fig. 2 depicts the trend of university-related patents, including university-only patents. Here, we add both types of university–industry collaboration patents as an “industry–university joint patent.” The data reveal a significant surge in the number of patents held by national universities since the implementation of institutional ownership in 2004. Other universities have also witnessed a gradual increase in patent numbers since 2000, influenced by policies promoting the commer - cialization of academic activities, such as the TLO Act of 1998 and the University Intellectual Property Headquarters Development Program in 2013. However, the upward trend for nonnational universities is comparatively smoother and less dramatic than that for national uni - versities. Regarding industry–university joint patents, an upward trend is observed for national universities but not for other universities. K. Motohashi et al.

{"page_content": "Using the results of identifying patent inventors as described in the previous section, we construct panel data at the researcher level, patent counts by a researcher, and application year. We selected researchers with academic activities before and after 2004. Academic activities are measured by research paper publications based on linking the research paper author with the patent inventor for academic researchers [ 30 ]. Using research paper information, we identified researchers with no patent applications before and after 2004. We used four-year windows around 2004, that is, before the incor - poration of national universities (2000 – 2003) and after incorporation (2005 – 2008),. In our empirical setting, it is essential to find university researchers whose affiliation information can be identified through patents or research papers. Thus, we only included researchers who met any of the following three criteria in the sample. • Researchers with at least one patented invention within four years before and four years after incorporation • Researchers with at least one patented invention within four years before incorporation and at least one published paper within four years after incorporation • Researchers with at least one published paper within four years before incorporation and at least one patented invention within four years after incorporation. Table 2 presents the transition matrix of the changes in patent application activities of the university researchers analyzed in this study during the four years before and after the incorporation of national universities. The analysis covers 9,965 researchers — 7,355 and 2,610 affiliated with national and private universities, respectively. Approxi - mately half of these researchers applied for patents after the national universities were incorporated. A total of 55.5 % of researchers who applied for patents after the incorporation of national universities were affiliated with national universities and 45.0 % were affiliated with private universities. Before the incorporation, when patent applicants in national uni - versities were divided into solo university applications and applications from industry – academia collaborations, the ratio of researchers who only applied for industry – academia collaboration patents was the highest (22.3 %), followed by those who only applied for university- alone patents at (15.9 %). After incorporation, 55.3 % of the re - searchers were involved only in solo university patenting applications, whereas 25.5 % had experience in both solo university patenting and industry – academia applications. Therefore, the number of researchers who applied for solo university patents increased after incorporation, and the ratio of researchers who applied for patents through indus - try – academia collaborations decreased substantially by 7.8 %. Although this trend is more evident at national universities, it is also observed among private university researchers. Next, using data at the researcher level, we analyze the effect of the incorporation of national universities on the quantity and quality of university patents. The model used for the estimation is as follows: E [ y it ] = α i + β × after 2004 t + γ × national i × after 2004 t + ∑ k θ k I ( age i = k ) + ε it (1) where the explained variable y it is the number of patents or the aggre - gated number of citations accrued to patents filed by researcher i in period t and is assumed to follow a negative binominal distribution. In addition, the analysis covers two periods — 2000 – 2003 and 2005 – 2008. after 20 04 t is a dummy variable that takes the value of 1 if period t is after 2004 (i.e., after incorporation) and 0 otherwise. national i is a dummy variable that takes the value of 1 if researcher i belongs to a national university and 0 if the researcher belongs to a nonnational university. γ is a coefficient indicating the treatment effect of national university incorporation.

These results are consistent with the trend presented in Table 1, indicating that compared with researchers at private universities, researchers at na - tional universities increased their number of patent applications around the time of the national universities ’ incorporation. Additionally, while patents applied for by universities themselves significantly increased, the number of industry – academia patents filed solely by companies decreased. Table 5 presents the effect of incorporating national universities on the quality (number of citations) of patents. Here, by normalizing the raw numbers by dividing the average of citation counts by application year and IPC subclass, we use two types of citation counts — the raw numbers ( ncited_all ) and the standardized ones ( ncited_std ). As discussed earlier, because the incorporation of national universities has a positive effect on patent applications, the natural logarithm of the number of patent applications is added as an explanatory variable to control the effect of changes in the overall number of applications. The analysis results depict the effect on the average number of citations of patents filed by researchers. For the heterogeneity of each researcher unit, we control the ratio of industry – academia collaboration patents for each researcher for the entire period ( npat_ui_shr ) and the point in time when researchers started their research (i.e., the year when they first applied for a patent or a paper (age-fixed effect)). The subjects of the analysis are researchers who applied for at least one patent in both periods.

{"page_content": "dummy for postincorporation of national universities (after2004) was positive and significant at the 10 % level. Additionally, there was a significant positive effect of national university incorporation at the 5 % level for the number of citations (ncited_std) and nonself-citations by universities (ncited_nonself_univ), standardized by IPC four digits and application year. Models 3–6 set the explanatory variables as nonself-citation by firms (ncited_nonself_firm), nonself-citation by universities (ncited_nonself_u - niv), self-citation by firms (ncited_self_firm), and self-citation by univer - sities (ncited_self_univ). The coefficients of the cross terms of the national university affiliation dummy (national) and the national university postincorporation dummy (after2004) are positive and significant only for the nonself-citation by firms in Model 3 but not significant for the others. Thus, according to the DID model of private universities, other than national universities as comparison groups, the qualitative increase in patents at national universities was due to their patents being cited by more companies. Thus, the activation of IP activities at universities following the na - tional university reform made university research activities more visible, particularly for firms that did not have a previous relationship with the university. Although a national university researcher dissemi - nates her research through publications, patented technology, as a commercial research output, must attract more private firms’ attention [ 31 ]. 6. Conclusion After national universities were incorporated in 2004, they could claim patent rights, resulting in a significant increase in the number of patents held by universities. This study examined the quantity and quality of university patents before and after incorporation. Prior to incorporation, most patents resulting from industry–academia collabo - rations were filed independently by companies and were not considered university patents. However, by examining the invention information, patents can be identified as industry–academia collaboration patents when faculty members are listed as inventors. Since 2004, the number of patents from national universities, including university-only patents and industry–academia joint application patents, has increased. However, there is insignificant change in the number of industry–academia collaboration patents when considering single-application patents from companies in which universities are involved. Moreover, there were some patents in which the head of the uni - versity was the applicant, even before the incorporation of national universities. However, these patents were rare and resulted from gov - ernment or other organizations’ extensive research and development (R&D) projects. The significant increase in patents involving national universities after incorporation is mainly attributed to universities filing patents independently, which was made possible by changes to patent ownership regulations. This study examined the impact of incorporation on university pat - ents by comparing patents involving researchers from national univer - sities before and after incorporation with those involving researchers from other types of universities during the same period. It was found that 55.5 % of national university researchers who had at least one patent from 2001 to 2008 had not applied for a patent before 2003, implying that they only began to participate in patenting activities after incorporation. Over 80 % of these researchers were only involved in patents filed solely by the university after incorporation, indicating that approximately 43.4 % of all researchers began to apply for university- alone patents for research results not involving industry–academia collaboration after incorporation. However, the remaining 44.5 % of researchers at national univer - sities involved in patenting before incorporation can be classified into three categories—only university applicant patents (15.9 %), only in industry–academia joint invention patents (22.3 %), and both (6.3 %). Most researchers solely involved in university-alone patent applications were not involved in industry–academia collaboration patents after incorporation. On the contrary, 75 % of researchers involved in patents related to industry–academia collaborations before incorporation continued to be involved in such collaborations after incorporation. Furthermore, we estimated a DID model to quantitatively analyze the changes in the quantity and quality of patents before and after the reform, using the patenting activities of private universities and other institutions that were not affected by the national university reform authorizing patent ownership as a control sample. The results revealed that after the reform, national university patents increased in quantity and quality, as measured by the number of patent applications and citations. It was also found that the quality improvement was caused mainly by an increase in the number of citations from the private sector. Thus, the increase in the number of university patents due to national university reforms may have increased research benefits for society. This implies that university ownership of IP may facilitate the diffusion of university knowledge to industry—one of the primary objectives of science policy across countries (especially for the tech transfer community). We argue that this finding is due to the following reasons.

Thus, the increase in the number of university patents due to national university reforms may have increased research benefits for society. This implies that university ownership of IP may facilitate the diffusion of university knowledge to industry—one of the primary objectives of science policy across countries (especially for the tech transfer community). We argue that this finding is due to the following reasons. The first relates to the nature of the patent system in its role of encouraging follow-on inventions. Documenting/disclosing the detailed technical information of existing inventions helps inventors learn about existing inventions and build their inventions on them. This mechanism can work well for firms that seek commercially valuable university knowledge to support their R&D. Before the reform, most national university researchers did not patent their research outcomes even if they had strong commercial potential. In contrast, after the reform, national universities were authorized to engage in standalone patenting and researchers were encouraged to file patents (as it was one of the criteria for researcher performance evaluation). Thus, national univer - sities’ research outcomes with commercial potential are revealed to the world via patenting, and firms could be better informed by searching for university knowledge with commercial potential. This can increase firms’ patent citations of university patents. Second, the reform could have induced national university re - searchers to engage more in research with academic and commercial potential as university and researcher patenting became part of the performance criteria after the reform [ 25 ]. This change could generate more academic research with commercial potential than that before the reform, which naturally draws firms’ attention to academic research for its R&D relevance. In either case, we argue that the reform contributed to improve the diffusion of university knowledge to industry—a science policy objec - tive in many countries. The impact of institutional ownership of uni - versity patents and technology transfer through TLO activities varies by national innovation systems, and the level of activity in European countries is less positive than in the US [ 7 ]. Unlike in the US, Japan’s innovation system is more similar to that of European countries, where national and other public universities have a greater influence. How - ever, industry–academia collaboration policies, mainly through the re - form of national university corporations, have produced some positive results. Compared with Sweden, where patents cannot be attributed to universities [ 13 ], and Italy, where changes in the system are more frequent, Japan’s major institutional reform, which makes national universities continue to be the core of its innovation system, is the backdrop of its innovation system. Our findings only implicate the policy impact over a short period. For the four-year window, the reform might have been close to an external shock, but from a long-term perspective, universities and firms could have considered the reform and reflected it in their patenting decisions and invention activities. After 20 years of national universities’ incor - poration in 2004, the reform of the national university system is still an important policy agenda, in which a series of changes have been intro - duced. For example, an evaluation system to consider the heterogeneity of each university was introduced in 2016. All national universities are K. Motohashi et al.

This opens new research opportunities by examining the different impacts of university patents according to uni - versity objectives. In addition, although our analysis implied that university patents increasingly served as inputs for firms ’ invention activities after the reform, whether and to what extent the reform encouraged firms to invest more in (formally) incorporating university knowledge into their R & D processes remains unclear. An analysis of the changes in the portion of university research in the composition of knowledge sources for Japanese firms ’ R & D after the reform with firm-level survey data can help answer this question. By complementing the research on behavioral changes on the firm side with our analysis of university patents, it is possible to examine the structural impact of the national university re - forms of Japan on its national innovation system.

Most previous studies proposed factors influencing digital innovation mainly from an organisational perspective, and the impact of external environmental factors has been ignored to a certain extent. To explore the impact of external factors such as digital infrastructure and the regulatory environment, this study surveyed a sample of 346 en- terprises in China operating in both the core industries of digital economy and traditional industries and analysed using SPSS and AMOS. The findings reveal that digital infrastructure and the regulatory environment positively and significantly a digital innovation. The flow of data elements within a digital innovation ecosystem mediates the relationship between external factors and organisational digital innovation. Our findings enrich the theory of digital innovation ecosystems and provide a reference for enterprises to seize external resources, and for poli- cymakers to focus on policies and regulations that facilitate the flow of data. 1. Introduction Digital technology, such as 5G, artificial intelligence, cloud computing, and big data, promoted the arrival of intelligent in- terconnections among all things, gradually changing the fundamentals of the industrial economy [ 1 ], business model [ 2 ], and how firms innovate [ 3 ], and produced a new paradigm of organisational innova- tion, namely digital innovation [ 4 ]. In the context of digital environ- ment, a traditional business model may no longer be viable [ 5 ]. Digital innovation, as an important means of digital transformation, continu- ously reshapes product and service design, market models and business models through digital technology [ 6 ]. In this process, the construction of digital infrastructure accelerates the flow of information and reduces the cost of acquiring and exchanging information [ 7 ], whereas gov- ernment support, like policy support for new industries or national strategic industries through special government investment, is closely associated to the regulatory environment of the digital economy [ 8 ]. For example, ‘Digital Strategy 2025 ’ in Germany, and ‘Outline of Digital Economy Development Strategy ’ in China [ 9 ]. In 2022, the United States enacted the Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors (CHIPS) Act, aiming to provide subsidies and corresponding tax breaks for chip manufacturers [ 10 ] to facilitate the development of digital innovation in the United States. During the process of promoting digital innovation, data elements are important drivers [ 11 ]; thus, data acces- sibility and mobility are central to sustained growth and innovation among digital businesses [ 12 ]. Data element, just like capital and labour, can be a factor of pro- duction [ 13 ]. Data element refers to data resources that are electroni- cally recorded during social production and business activities, integrating with other factors of production, and continuously iterating to bring economic and social benefits to users or owners [ 14 ]. Data element has important economic-technical characteristics such as non-competitiveness, non-exclusivity, low replication costs, external- ities, permeability, dependence, virtual substitution, and self-organisation [ 15 ]. Data flow refers to the transfer and interaction of data elements among different regions, fields, and departments [ 16 ]. There are approximately three ways to realise the flow of data: data openness, data trading, and data exchange [ 17 ]. The flow of public-sector data mainly adopts the method of data openness, and government agencies that have access to public data resources * Corresponding author.

Private-sector data flows through data transactions and data exchanges by micro-enterprises that own data resources. Among them, data exchange is essentially a special form of data exchange, similar to bartering in commodity trading [18]. The flow of data elements between regions, departments and enterprises has made the digital innovation ecosystem gradually emerge and become the soil for innovation in the digital era [19]. The emergence of digital innovation has provided enterprises with unprecedented opportunities; however, not all businesses are able to seize these opportunities, and some are still struggling and mired in digital transformation [20]. One reason is that in the digital era, it be- comes extremely difficult to benefit from innovation because of the nature of digital technologies (e.g. digital technologies are very easy to imitate) [21]. Besides, as technologies required for R&D of digital innovation become more sophisticated, so to do the costs and risks of engaging in innovation activities [22], especially the digital infrastruc- ture that underpins innovation, are complex to build and evolve owing to its layered modular architecture [1]; organisations need to quickly improve or iterate on digital infrastructure to respond to changes in response to external demands for flexibility and agility [23].It is difficult for most companies that are short-term profit seekers to plan and implement original innovation activities that require opportunity costs and long R&D cycles [24]. In addition, companies need to adapt to changes in the digital environment while overcoming the associated societal barriers [25], as disputes in data ownership, data rights and interest distribution, data value assessment privacy protection, and na- tional security increased [26–28], accompanied by the generation and circulation of data. Therefore, owing to the high complexity, uncer- tainty, and high risk of organisational digital innovation, the external environment such as regional digital infrastructure construction and government policy guidance and support are particularly important for companies to carry out digital innovation [29]. Furthermore, in current digital economy practices, as the flow of data elements is far from reaching a state of full sharing, the existing data market size is far less than the real value of the data elements [18]. Previous studies proposed multiple factors that influence digital innovation, most of which were proposed from an organisational or micro perspective [30]. From the theoretical perspective, most existing research focuses on the theory of resource base view (RBV), such as analysing relational networks [31], organisational agility [32], digital culture [33], and ambidextrous innovation ability [34]. However, these studies somewhat ignore the impact of external factors on organisational digital innovation and the multiplier effect of data elements, which have the characteristics of low replication cost, non-competition, and exter- nality on labour, capital, and technological factors [35]. According to the theory of the digital innovation ecosystem, as an element of inno- vation, data can transcend the limitations of physical space and flow freely in the digital innovation ecosystem [36], thus activating, con- necting, and aggregating the innovation activities of multiple subjects [19]. Digital infrastructure can help data elements exchange informa- tion beyond geographical restrictions, making the transmission of in- formation more efficient, whereas an appropriate regulatory environment can ensure safe and effective data sharing. These external factors can further improve an enterprise’s willingness to engage in digital innovation. The Chinese context is fertile ground for exploring theories related to the construction and governance of digital innovation ecosystems. In recent years, China’s digital innovation has grown significantly [24], and many outstanding digital platform enterprises have emerged, such as Tencent, Haier, JD.com, and Alibaba [37]. Additionally, China has a good foundation for the construction of digital infrastructure. These resources provided a rich basis for this study. Furthermore, China’s institutional environment and market environment are extremely com- plex and unique [38]. Under the logic of ‘crossing the river by feeling the stones’, many new digital platforms have ‘grown savagely’ in the context of institutional void, which provides rich research materials for exploring the construction and governance of the digital-related regu- latory environment. In addition, the lack of motivation for enterprises to engage in digital innovation, especially for original breakthrough [24, 37], and not realizing the full value of data elements [18,39] are also perplexing China.

From the perspective of digital innovation ecosystems, this study integrates the two critical external influencing factors of organisational digital innovation: digital infrastructure and the regulatory environ- ment, exploring the mediating role of data flows, aiming to form syn- ergistic digital innovation ecosystems, strengthen the dominant position of enterprises in scientific and technological innovation, motivate en- terprises to carry out digital", "metadata": {"producer": "Acrobat Distiller 8.1.0 (Windows)", "creator": "Elsevier", "creationdate": "2025-04-26T11:38:27+00:00", "crossmarkdomains[1]": "elsevier.com", "crossmarkmajorversiondate": "2010-04-23", "creationdate--text": "26th April 2025", "elsevierwebpdfspecifications": "7.0.1", "robots": "noindex", "moddate": "2025-04-26T11:46:17+00:00", "author": "Yue Xia", "doi": "10.1016/j.techsoc.2024.102802", "keywords": "Organisational digital innovation,Digital innovation ecosystem,Data flows,Digital infrastructure,Regulatory environment", "title": "How external factors influence organisational digital innovation: Evidence from China", "subject": "Technology in Society, 81 (2025) 102802. doi:10.1016/j.techsoc.2024.102802", "crossmarkdomains[2]": "sciencedirect.com", "crossmarkdomainexclusive": "true", "source": "data\\How-external-factors-influence-organisational-digital-inn_2025_Technology-in.pdf", "total_pages": 15, "page": 1, "page_label": "2", "start_index": 0}}

Exploring the construction and governance of digital innovation ecosystems in the Chinese context to contribute to existing theories and guides Chinese management practices. From the perspective of digital innovation ecosystems, this study integrates the two critical external influencing factors of organisational digital innovation: digital infrastructure and the regulatory environ- ment, exploring the mediating role of data flows, aiming to form syn- ergistic digital innovation ecosystems, strengthen the dominant position of enterprises in scientific and technological innovation, motivate en- terprises to carry out digital innovation, and promote the flow and sharing of data elements. The main contributions of this study are as follows. First, unlike most existing studies based on the RBV researching the influence of organisational internal resources on digital innovation [40,41], this study is based on digital innovation ecosystem theory, taking digital infrastructure and the regulatory environment as the external environment of the ecosystem, and taking the flow of data el- ements as a link between the external environment and the behaviour of innovation subjects. Second, the results show that sound digital infra- structure construction outside the enterprise and the support of the government in the regulatory environment have a direct role in pro- moting the digital innovation activities of enterprises. This is conducive to stimulating the willingness of innovation subjects to carry out digital innovation activities from the outside and provides ideas to solve the problem of insufficient subjective initiative of innovation subjects to carry out digital innovation from different perspectives. Third, this study finds that the flow of data elements significantly promotes enterprises’ digital innovation and that the external environment can also indirectly affect enterprises’ digital innovation activities through data flows. These findings highlight the importance of data flows, providing a basis for the introduction of policies to promote the flow and sharing of data ele- ments, and are conducive to giving full play to the multiplier effect of data elements. Finally, unlike existing studies [8,42] that often use partially publicly available secondary data from institutions or govern- ments, this study confirms that sound digital infrastructure and gov- ernment support have become new drivers of China’s digital innovation ecosystem through primary data from the Chinese context. The conclusion of this study suggests theoretical guidance for policymakers to explore and formulate policies and regulations related to innovation cultivation and provide a decision-making reference for enterprises’ innovation activities to enhance their competitiveness in the digital era. Hence, this study builds a research framework on the relationship be- tween digital infrastructure, the regulatory environment, and organ- isational digital innovation through the mechanism of data flows. Specifically, this study attempts to answer the following questions. RQ1. What is the impact of digital infrastructure and the regulatory environment on organisational digital innovation? RQ2. How do digital infrastructure and the regulatory environment affect organisational digital innovation? 2. Literature review and hypothesis development 2.1. Digital innovation In recent years, digital innovation has become a popular topic in innovation research. Digital innovation is defined from the perspectives of innovation outcomes [43], innovation processes [2], and holistic perspectives [44].

Accord- ing to this definition, digital innovation can be further divided into digital product innovation [45], digital process innovation [46], digital organisational innovation [47], and digital business model innovation [48]. Digital innovation is characterised by convergence [2], self-growth [48], multi-agent interactions, dependence on the flow of data elements [49]. Digital technology [50], internal organisational [51], digital talent [52], institutional [53], and data environment factors [19] can affect onganisational digital innovation. The theoretical perspective of most existing literature focuses on RBV, such as studies in relational networks [31], organisational agility [32], digital culture [33], and ambidextrous innovation capabilities [34]. Many scholars use the Technology-Organization-Environment (TOE) framework [54] to explain the multi-factor synergistic linkage mechanism of the digital innovation process, such as studying the impact of TOE factor linkage on enterprise digital innovation [29,50]. In recent years, scholars have used the idea of biological evolution to study digital innovation activities from an ecosystem perspective. Some scholars argue that the digital innovation ecosystem is a social ecosystem composed of digital innovation-related industrial entities based on competition and cooperation [55]. A digital innovation ecosystem can be recognised as a fusion of ‘digital innovation’ and the ‘innovation ecosystem’ [55]. Beltagui et al. contend that, owing to the introduction of digital elements, the elements of innovation are reor- ganised, and the logic of system behavior also changes, leading to a synergistic symbiosis between digital innovation subjects [56]. Within digital innovation ecosystems, the convergence attribute of digital technology, as an important infrastructure, effectively improves the ef- ficiency of resource allocation and data processing in the process of digital innovation, and enables the cross-border flow of digital innova- tion resources [57]. The digital innovation ecosystem has the characteristics of the digitization of innovation elements, virtualisation of participants, and ecology of inter-subject relationships [58]. The formation of a digital innovation ecosystem is guided by value creation, which emphasises the interdependence of technology [59]. With the introduction of data ele- ments, organisational boundaries under the traditional business model are further dissolved, the concept of boundaries within and between enterprises has become blurred, industrial boundaries have been grad- ually broken, and the operating logic of business activities is changing dynamically [60]. In summary, most prior studies on the factors influ- encing enterprises’ digital innovation are based on the RBV. The impact of external resources on organizational digital innovation behaviour through ecological thinking has been ignored to a certain extent, and the mechanism by which the external environment affects enterprise digital innovation behaviour remains unclear. 2.2. Digital infrastructure Digital infrastructure refers to the basic digital technology, organ- isational structure, and related services or facilities that support the operation of enterprises or industries, and in the form of a shared, un- bounded, heterogeneous, open and evolving socio-technical system, including diverse digital technology capabilities and user installation, operation and design communities [31]. Digital infrastructure is posi- tively related to enterprise innovation [61,62], and this driving effect exhibits strong structural characteristics, particularly for non-state-owned and high-tech enterprises [63]. Robust digital infra- structure, including internet connectivity and all types of information networks, can help enterprises take the lead in newer production methods and successfully conduct innovation programmes [64]. How- ever, because of the hierarchical and modular architecture of digital infrastructure [1], which makes it extremely complex to build and evolve, organisations need to quickly improve or iterate on digital infrastructure to respond to changes in response to the external demands for flexibility and agility [23]. It is difficult for most companies that are short-term profit seekers, to plan and implement original innovation activities that require opportunity costs and long R&D cycles [24]. Therefore, external support, such as regional digital infrastructure construction, is particularly important for companies to carry out digital innovation [29]. However, existing research focuses on the relationship between digital infrastructure and enterprise innovation, focusing on digital infrastructure at the enterprise level, and ignores, to some extent, the impact of external digital infrastructure construction on the orga- nisation’s digital innovation activities, such as local information infra- structure (5G network, Internet of Things (IoT), industrial Internet, data centers, etc.), converged infrastructure (industrial IoT (IIoT), intelligent transportation infrastructure, etc.), and innovation infrastructure (large-scale scientific research platforms, science and education infra- structure, etc.). According to digital innovation ecosystem theory, firms are willing to innovate using open external contracts rather than closed vertical integration; thus, the trajectory of value creation shifts from inside to outside the business [65].

According to digital innovation ecosystem theory, firms are willing to innovate using open external contracts rather than closed vertical integration; thus, the trajectory of value creation shifts from inside to outside the business [65]. This shift makes digital innovation process inseparable from the digital infrastructure within the organisation and the ecosystem in which it operates [44]. Digital infrastructure can be at the industry, national, or even global level [66]. At the industry level, the digital infrastructure outside these enterprises is part of the inno- vation environment that enables smooth flow and rational allocation of innovation and innovation resources, breaks down the original enter- prise and industry barriers [60], promotes cross-industry and cross-field cooperation, and promotes the integration of innovation subjects through mutual learning and resource sharing to form a close innovation network relationship [67]. The construction of digital infrastructure has reduced the cost of acquiring and exchanging information and enabled innovative actors to easily and quickly access the most advanced tech- nological information [7], improving the efficiency of innovation [68, 69], providing the core competencies needed for digital innovation by enterprises within the ecosystem [70,71]. Regionally, digital infra- structure can break down spatial barriers to information transmission, promote cross-regional cooperation in innovation processes, and help enterprises identify innovation opportunities with higher R&D value [72]. Digital infrastructure such as digital communication platforms can mitigate the impact of uncertainty propagation [73], and help govern- ments understand the entire business ecosystem [74]. Based on existing literature, we propose hypothesis H 1. H1. The construction of sound digital infrastructure that outside en- terprises positively related to organisational digital innovation. 2.3. Regulatory environment The regulatory environment reflects the local government’s support for digital technology, digital markets, and digital talent, the govern- ment’s supervision of the collection and use of user data by digital market entities, and unfair competition in the digital market [75]. The flow of data elements, the empowerment of digital technology, and the organisation of digital platforms make digital innovation completely different from traditional technological innovation, showing an ecological structure and operational characteristics [19], and bringing new challenges to the innovation activities of enterprises. The genera- tion and circulation of data activate the innovative behaviours of many different types of subjects but also increase the complexity of data ownership relations [26], data rights and interest distribution [26,27], data value assessment [26], privacy protection [28], and national se- curity [76]. The rise of digital platforms and markets has also brought great challenges to regulators, stimulating the need to regulate issues such as antitrust and the abuse of dominance [77]. Digital innovation policies formulated and implemented by governments are conducive to the circulation and sharing of information, reduces transaction costs, and improves regional innovation performance [78].

Specific policies such as the information con- sumption pilot policy and tax reduction policy can significantly promote the development of the digital economy through innovation promotion effect [ 37, 80 ]. In view of this,we propose H2 as follows. H2. The regulatory environment positively related to organisational digital innovation. 2.4. Data flows 2.4.1. Definition of data flows In the book Data Journeys in the Sciences, Leonelli and Tempini [ 81 ] defined journeys of data as designating the movement of data from their production site to many other sites where they are processed, mobilised and re-purposed. In addition, many scholars studied data flows from a technical perspective, and discussed data flows in the context of specific research questions. For example, in the data warehouse (DW) context, the extract-transform-load (ETL) process enables data integration. Generally, an ETL process represents a data-intensive flow (or data flow). The ETL process extracts, cleanses, and transforms data from multiple heterogeneous sources for further analysis [ 82 ]. From a tech- nical perspective, the flow of data improves the liquidity of data in the digital space through physical operations such as data transmission, access, storage, and editing, as well as the optimisation of algorithms and systems. Data flows can occur internally, or externally, regionally, nationally, or even globally as well as from technical and application systems, data networks, and physical and data spaces. The homogeni- sation of data comes with the emergence of new media that separate content from the medium offering it. Thus, the content can be stored or displayed on any device [ 83 ]. However, it is impossible for any system to open all data without restrictions. Therefore, there will be an uneven flow and sharing of data in space, that is, the generation of nodes in a specific space [ 84 ]. At the technical level, it is helpful to identify and describe the status and characteristics of data flows in practical appli- cation scenarios, such as cross-border access, transmission, transfer and use of data in the process of cross-border data flow, and to provide a specific focus for specific policy formulation of data governance. Although the definition of technology is widely recognised and applied, it does not account for the value creation of the digital economy in the process of data flow and iteration at the technical level. Ecological thinking is more in line with the dynamic, cyclical and adaptive characteristics of the mutual transformation between data, knowledge and value in the process of data flow. From an ecological perspective, data flows are actually data cycles with data value creation, data value transmission and data creation as the main links, which have an ecological structure and operation characteristics and constitutes the basic operational mechanism of data ecology [ 19 ]. In the process of data flow, the lack of a data flow link will restrict data circulation, which in turn will lead to an imbalance in the data ecosystem. According to ecological thinking, data flows are the flow of data-based knowledge and value among multiple subjects engaged in the full data life cycle, which can be deconstructed into three levels: digital data streams, flows of knowledge. and value flows [ 85 ]. Digital data streams are the continuous encoding and transmission of data related to events, including time, people, places, facts, methods, causes, and effects [ 86 ]. Knowledge flow refers to the transfer of data, information, and knowl- edge between individuals and systems, including sets of processes, events, and activities [ 87 ]. Value flows refer to the value-added differ- ence generated by the data element market players, including the pro- ducers of raw data, producers of data sets and data analysts who participate in the collection, storage, analysis and application of data. They guide the value flow to form a closed loop of the value chain with a positive feedback effect [ 85 ]. From the perspective of data circulation, knowledge and ideas are generated from data. Digital data streams are fundamental, drive the flow of information, and promote the accumu- lation and creation of knowledge. The digital era offers a new mean for dynamic open innovation in widespread ecosystems [ 88 ]. Data elements can break through the boundaries of time and space and flow efficiently as innovation elements, creating favorable condi- tions for open innovation through which innovation subjects break through organisational boundaries and integrate internal and external innovation resources [ 43 ]. The flow of data elements can break the boundaries between innovation subjects, expand the innovation network space, render enterprises no longer the only innovation sub- jects, strengthen collaboration between innovation subjects, promote cross-field and cross-regional collaborative innovation of various inno- vation subjects, and continuously", "metadata": {"producer": "Acrobat Distiller 8.1.0 (Windows)", "creator": "Elsevier", "creationdate": "2025-04-26T11:38:27+00:00", "crossmarkdomains[1]": "elsevier.com", "crossmarkmajorversiondate": "2010-04-23", "creationdate--text": "26th April 2025", "elsevierwebpdfspecifications": "7.0.1", "robots": "noindex", "moddate": "2025-04-26T11:46:17+00:00", "author": "Yue Xia", "doi": "10.1016/j.techsoc.2024.102802", "keywords": "Organisational digital innovation,Digital innovation ecosystem,Data flows,Digital infrastructure,Regulatory environment", "title": "How external factors influence organisational digital innovation: Evidence from China", "subject": "Technology in Society, 81 (2025) 102802. doi:10.1016/j.techsoc.2024.102802", "crossmarkdomains[2]": "sciencedirect.com", "crossmarkdomainexclusive": "true", "source": "data\\How-external-factors-influence-organisational-digital-inn_2025_Technology-in.pdf", "total_pages": 15, "page": 3, "page_label": "4", "start_index": 0}}

Purposeful managed knowledge flows across organisational boundaries during data flows [ 89 ] and value is increasingly co-created in digital ecosystems and marketplaces [ 90 ]. Combining the digital innovation ecosystem perspective [ 19 ] and the view of decomposing data flows into digital data streams, knowledge flows, and value flows [ 85 ], we believe that data flows are the transfer and interaction of data elements between different regions, fields, and departments. Through the transformation from ‘data stream ’ to ‘knowledge flows ’ and then to ‘value flows ’, the value creation of data is finally realised. 2.4.2. Digital infrastructure and data flows Based on the definition of data flow, mobility is a prerequisite for realizing the value of data. The rapidly development of digital infra- structure provides a good foundation for data flows [ 85 ], which pro- foundly affects the rate and direction of flow of data and promotes the agglomeration of digital innovation resources [ 91 ]. The sharing and interconnection of digital infrastructure accelerate the real-time ex- change of information at almost zero marginal cost, improve the effi- ciency of knowledge flow, and promote the spread of innovative elements between industries cities [ 92 ]. More specifically, information infrastructure, such as 5G network, IoT, and data centers, can help reduce the cost of data transmission and build a bridge for data circu- lation [ 61 ]. Converged infrastructure, such as the IIoT, can help enter- prises build a production system with data resources as its core and dig deeper into the value of data resources [ 93 ]. For example, the industrial Internet can transform the value creation model of enterprises from simple product supply to \"product + service\", and realise real-time interaction between multiple systems such as product production, quality assurance and user feedback [ 94 ], thereby promoting value creation. Innovation, science, and education infrastructure, can help promote the sharing of various data-based achievements among enter- prises and the efficient transformation of future technologies [ 95 ]. Based on the available literature, H 3 is proposed as follows. H3. Digital infrastructure positively relates to data flows. 2.4.3. Regulatory environment and data flows By integrating and optimizing resource allocation, data elements can drive the economy and society in a more efficiently and intelligently. This process requires the guidance and support of policies. The gov- ernment and relevant institutions provide favorable conditions for dig- ital technology innovation and ecosystem construction by formulating policies to encourage digital innovation, providing innovation financial support, and building innovation service platforms. Simultaneously, by establishing a reasonable intellectual property protection mechanism and fair market access rules, digital innovation achievements can be protected and more enterprises and individuals can be incentivised to participate in innovation activities [ 96 ]. In this process, the data sharing mechanism and open platform established by the government have become key, providing channels for the cross-border flow of data Y. Xia and M.G.

Conversely, because the nature of data is different from that of factors of production such as land and capital, a series of institutional changes developed and introduced by governments around data privacy, secu- rity, property rights, and restrictions on cross-border flows can also affect data flows within ecosystems [19], but stricter data policies are expected to adversely affect industries that rely on data in their pro- duction processes [98]. Based on the literature, we propose H 4 as follows. H4.: The regulatory environment positively relates to data flows. 2.4.4. Data flows and digital innovation Traditional innovation is based on the input and reorganisation of traditional production factors such as human resources and capital, and reconstructs the production function to achieve innovation. In the dig- ital era, data elements are used as new production and innovation fac- tors in innovation activities to, optimise resource allocation and promote the evolution of innovation models [99]. On the one hand, the development of digital technologies such as big data and cloud computing has derived a large amount of data resources, which become data elements and can become innovation elements after the process of mining, collection, and cleaning, enriching the innovation element system. On the other hand, data elements can break through economic boundaries, achieve deep integration with other innovation factors, reconstruct a combination of production factors, and improve produc- tion and innovation efficiency. Specifically, in the decision-making process, the integration of data elements and human capital factor can accurately capture innovation information and improve the efficiency and quality of decision-making with big data as the carrier [100]. In the R&D process, data elements break the limitations of time and space, enable multiple subjects to participate in innovation activities across time and space, reduce the constraints of innovation activities, and improve the efficiency of innovation activities [101]. In terms of the application of achievements, the empowerment of data elements can shorten the cycle of achievement transformation and improve the effi- ciency of achievement transformation. Data elements can break through the boundaries of time and space and flow efficiently in the digital innovation ecosystem as innovation elements. The flow of data elements can cross the boundaries between innovation subjects, expand the innovation network space, and promote cross-field and cross-regional collaborative innovation among innova- tion subjects [60]. In this process, the agglomeration of multiple inno- vation subjects constitutes an innovation ecosystem, and realises the overall evolution of the innovation model. The flow of data elements in a digital innovation ecosystem can drive the concentration of knowledge, technology, capital, and talent to more efficient areas and improve resource misallocation [102]. Consequently, data flows enable synergies by consolidating and optimizing resource allocation, thereby fostering digital innovation. Therefore, data elements can transcend the limita- tions of physical space and flow freely in the digital innovation ecosystem, reflecting a strong geospatial spillover effect [36], thereby promoting cross-industry, cross-field and even cross-border cooperation and communication to increase the output of digital innovation. Among these, the openness of public data enables governments, enterprises, research institutions and other entities to share important data in the fields of society, economy, environment and other fields, and the data flow between enterprises enables different enterprises to share each other’s data resources, achieve synergies, and promote product and service innovation. This kind of cooperation is not limited to the same industry, but also stimulates the generation of new business models and innovative ideas across industries, and the international data flow can help to achieve the efficient allocation of global resources and promote international cooperation and exchange [96]. These studies provide a platform to develop Hypothesis 5 (H 5 ). H5. Data flows positively relate to digital innovation. 2.4.5. Mediating effect of data flows In the process of digital infrastructure indirectly influencing organ- isational digital innovation, data flows become a link between the external environment and the digital innovation subjects. First, the construction of digital infrastructure reduces the real-time exchange cost and breaks down the spatial barriers of information exchange [92], which significantly reduce the cost of data flows, promote the free flow of data elements as innovation elements in the digital innovation ecosystem, and enable an all-round breakthrough from factor monopoly to reasonable sharing [61]. On this basis, data elements are gathered on different platforms through flow, and by applying innovation to different scenarios, the product value space is continuously expanded, and the performance of enterprise digital innovation is improved. Simultaneously, various platforms provide new channels for the cross-space dissemination and diffusion of data elements with the help of the network-link advantages of industrial digitalisation, thereby achieving continuous increase in marginal benefits and improving the digital innovation performance of enterprises.

The flow of data elements can contin- uously promote the transformation of the production modes and orga- nizational forms of traditional industries and empower the innovation and development of the real economy and digital industry [103]. Third, the construction and operation of digital infrastructure can form digital innovation ecosystems by enabling the agglomeration of industrial space. According to the theory of digital innovation ecosystems, the innovation and application of digital technology need to be supported by a good ecological environment. Building an open ecosystem that sup- ports digital innovation and fosters cooperation involves breaking down industry barriers, promoting cross-industry and cross-sector coopera- tion, and forming an interconnected and resource-sharing digital inno- vation network. This type of ecosystem can not only provide broader application scenarios and richer resources for digital innovation, but also promote the flow of knowledge and rapid iteration of technology, and accelerate the transformation and application of innovation achievements [96]. In addition, through the flow of data, enterprises in a system can easily obtain advanced general digital technologies, improve the level of technology spillovers, and realise the complementarity of digital technologies. Technology complementarity is conducive to reducing uncertainty in digital innovation activities, thereby improving an enterprise’s digital innovation performance [104]. Based on previous literature, we propose H 6 as follows. H6. Data flows mediate the relationship between digital infrastructure and digital innovation. The regulatory environment can influence the functioning of inno- vation systems and the interaction between innovation elements [105], thereby indirectly affecting firms’ innovation activities. Owing to the high complexity and uncertainty of digital innovation, the R&D risk of enterprises is greater; therefore, government policy guidance and sup- port are particularly important for organisational digital innovation [29]. The flow of data elements can promote the effective transmission of information between the market and the government and between government departments [106], and encourage the government to make better use of digital economy-related policies, which are an important tool for scientific and technological innovation, simplifying the process procedures of digital enterprises, providing enterprise services, and pooling the creativity of talent, so that digital economy-related policies can better release the incentive energy of innovation [107].

Therefore, H 7 was proposed as follows. H7. Data flows mediate the relationship between regulatory environment and digital innovation. The conceptual framework shows the above hypotheses (as shown in Fig. 1 ). 3. Methodology 3.1. Sample and data collection This study employed structural equation modeling (SEM) to analyse the relationships among constructs. SEM is widely used to simulta- neously estimate a range of interrelationships between latent structures in a model [ 109 ]. Digital technologies have rapidly permeated every aspect of society and the economy, giving rise to new economic forms and comprehensive industrial and consumer transformations. In this revolution, both Internet-based companies, and companies in traditional industries, such as textile manufacturing and pharmaceuticals, are implementing new business models and formats triggered by the digital economy. Therefore, the research objectives of this study include not only companies in the core industries of the digital economy but also enterprises that have carried out or plan to carry out digital innovation in traditional industries. For companies that meet these requirements, it is not yet possible to determine the exact size of the target group. Ac- cording to data released by the National Bureau of Statistics of China (NBSC), more than 1,000,000 enterprises fit within the scope of the target population. In addition, as digital innovation has the characteristics of conver- gence, multi-agent interaction, and self-growth [ 2 ], the measurement of digital innovation is still in the exploratory stage. At present, the NBSC has a relatively clear definition of the digital economy and its core in- dustries, and in 2021 published the Statistical Classification of the Digital Economy and Its Core Industries (2021) standard. This standard accu- rately and comprehensively classifies the scope of the digital economy into five categories: digital product manufacturing, digital product ser- vices, digital technology applications, digital factor-driven industries, and digital efficiency improvement industries. The first four categories are defined as the core industries of the digital economy and represent the digital industrialisation part of the digital economy. Enterprises in the core industries of the digital economy have inherent advantages in digital innovation, which can be better reflected in their operations. These enterprises rely entirely on digital technology and data elements to conduct various economic activities and provide digital technologies, products, services, infrastructure, and solutions for the digital develop- ment of industries, which is an important supporting foundation for promoting digital technology innovation and digital business model transformation [ 110 ]. For example, enterprises in the digital product manufacturing industry of electronic components and equipment manufacturing, or enterprises in the digital product retail or digital product maintenance digital product service industry are important components of digital industrialisation, which are knowledge-intensive, networked, digital, and platform-based [ 111 ]. The fifth category of the digital efficiency improvement industry belongs to the industrial digitalisation part, which refers to the appli- cation of digital technology and data resources to increase the output and efficiency of traditional industries. It is the integration of digital technology and the real economy, covering all traditional industries that can be combined with the digital economy, such as smart agriculture, intelligent manufacturing, intelligent transportation, and smart logis- tics. The application of digital technologies to various enterprises in digital efficiency improvement industries can optimise production pro- cesses, improve resource allocation efficiency, and enhance market responsiveness [ 110 ], which is an important embodiment of digital process innovation and digital organisational innovation (the Fig. 1.

Considering the accessibility and availability of samples, we chose convenience sampling to collect data. Although commonly used, con- venience sampling may cause potential bias in the results [ 112 ] because respondents who are not involved in digital innovation are ignored. To minimise the impact of potential bias on the results, we selected man- agers, R & D staff, ICT staff and other employees who could be accessed by the research team as respondents. Both middle and senior managers and ordinary employees were suitable for this study. Top management understands the organization ’ s need to apply new technological break- throughs to solve problems [ 113 ], while ordinary employees are considered key contributors to the organisation ’ s innovation process [ 51 ]. Ordinary employees range from R & D or ICT professionals to middle managers within the company, as well as employees in other positions, such as HR, finance, and accounting. Primary data from the managers and employees of 346 enterprises in China were collected using questionnaires because the survey method is more convenient and flexible for collecting data, and the survey can be carried out in various forms, such as on-site answers, mailing, and entrusting a third party. Considering the availability of data, to ensure the quantity and quality of questionnaire distribution and collection, this study made full use of resource channels, such as schoolmates, relatives, friends, and acquaintances of the research team and group, to contact the target group. This study used a combination of online and offline methods to carry out research. Specifically, the first step was to complete the on-site distribution and completion of questionnaires in the field research and face-to-face negotiation of the research team members. Second, Questionnaire Star platform was used to edit the online questionnaire and send the questionnaire through Ding Talk, WeChat, and email. Enterprises that do not respond for more than two weeks will be invited to participate in the survey again by phone or email. Data collection was conducted from November 2023 to February 2024 and comprised two stages. In the first stage, data were collected face to face on the second Global Digital Trade Expo held in Hangzhou, China from 23rd to November 27, 2023. A seven-person team was responsible for face-to-face data collection. A total of 300 closed-ended questionnaires were distributed, of which 183 were turned back, with a 61 % response rate. After careful checking, 166 questionnaires were deemed valid and used for data analysis. The second stage began on 18th January and last to 15th February collecting data online through WeChat, Ding Talk, and emails. Online questionnaires used Question- naire Star platform and delivered to 400 managers and employees of enterprises in China. A total of 302 responses were collected, 180 of which were valid for data analysis. The overall response rate (ORR) was 69 %. Table 2 presents the demographic characteristics of the 346 respondents. 3.2. Constructs measurement Digital Infrastructure (IF), Regulatory Environment (RE), Digital Innovation (DIIN), and Data Flows (DTFL) are the four variables and latent constructs in this study. IF and RE are second-order constructs with subdimensions and their respective items. All the items in the survey were adapted from existing literature and were measured by 5- point Likert Scale with ‘5 ’ represents ‘strongly agree ’ and ‘1 ’ repre- sents strongly ‘disagree ’. Appendix 1 provides the details of the con- structs and relevant references. Digital Infrastructure (IF) measures cost, scale, and government in- centives to access digital infrastructure. IF is a second-order construct with 3 dimensions. According to the National Development and Reform Commission ’ s interpretation, digital infrastructure including informa- tion infrastructure (IoT, cloud computing, artificial intelligence, etc.); converged infrastructure (smart energy infrastructure and intelligent transportation infrastructure, etc.), and innovation infrastructure (technological education infrastructure, major technology infrastruc- ture, etc.) [ 114 ]. Three first-order constructs (INFO, CONV, and INNO) measured IF from these aspects. INFO is the first dimension of IF and has four items that measure the scale and how easily enterprises access in- formation infrastructure. CONV is the second dimension, with four items measuring the scale the scale and how easily enterprises access converged infrastructure that integrates digital technology into the traditional infrastructure. The INNO is the third dimension with four items measuring the scale, cost, and government incentives of enter- prises accessing innovation infrastructure. Regulatory Environment (RE) is another second-order construct that measures a firm ’ s external regulatory environment. RE is measured using two first-order constructs: namely Digital Regulations (DGRG) and Regulatory Measures (RGMS). The DGRG is the first dimension, measuring the enactment of government policies and", "metadata": {"producer": "Acrobat Distiller 8.1.0 (Windows)", "creator": "Elsevier", "creationdate": "2025-04-26T11:38:27+00:00", "crossmarkdomains[1]": "elsevier.com", "crossmarkmajorversiondate": "2010-04-23", "creationdate--text": "26th April 2025", "elsevierwebpdfspecifications": "7.0.1", "robots": "noindex", "moddate": "2025-04-26T11:46:17+00:00", "author": "Yue Xia", "doi": "10.1016/j.techsoc.2024.102802", "keywords": "Organisational digital innovation,Digital innovation ecosystem,Data flows,Digital infrastructure,Regulatory environment", "title": "How external factors influence organisational digital innovation: Evidence from China", "subject": "Technology in Society, 81 (2025) 102802. doi:10.1016/j.techsoc.2024.102802", "crossmarkdomains[2]": "sciencedirect.com", "crossmarkdomainexclusive": "true", "source": "data\\How-external-factors-influence-organisational-digital-inn_2025_Technology-in.pdf", "total_pages": 15, "page": 6, "page_label": "7", "start_index": 0}}

The DGRG is the first dimension, measuring the enactment of government policies and regulations in digital-related aspects, whereas the RGMS is the second dimension, measuring the supervision and governance of digital-related economic activities by local governments. Both the DGRG and RGMS have three items. Data Flows (DTFL) is a first-order construct that measures the rele- vant restrictions and provisions regarding the mobility and security of data elements which required to be comply with. Five items were used to tap responses to the DTFL. Digital Innovation (DIIN) is another first-order construct that mea- sures firms utilising and integrating digital technology in organisational arrangements, production, and business models using five items.

Common method variance Common method bias (CMB) can occur in the data collection process when the required data comes from a single source and self-presentation is the only way to respond [ 115 ]. To minimise the impact of CMB on the results of empirical research, this study not only explained the purpose and main research content of the questionnaire in the instructive part, but also made an anonymous commitment to the respondents, and clarified the estimated time and response requirements of the ques- tionnaire. The protection of respondents ’ personal private information is conducive to the expression of their true feelings and thus enhances the authenticity of the data obtained. Informing respondents about the length of the questionnaire will also help them allow enough time to answer the questionnaire and try to avoid the phenomenon of filling in the questionnaire due to time constraints. SPSS and AMOS were also used to evaluate the common method variance (CMV) of the samples to ensure the authenticity and validity of the empirical results. First, we employed Harman ’ s single-factor test using SPSS 28 to test CMV. The first unrotated factor explained only 38.58 % of the total variation ( Table 3 ), which was less than the 50 % threshold. This result indicated that there was no significant common method bias in the study data [ 116 ]. Second, according to Jordan and Troth [ 117 ], confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was used to further test the common method bias of the sample by comparing the fit of the benchmark model with the addition of a common method factor. As shown in Table 4, compared with the original model, the change of the model fitting index after adding the common method factor is small, and the goodness of fit does not change significantly ( Δ χ 2 /d ƒ = 0.056, Δ CFI = 0.004, Δ RMSEA = 0.002), indi- cating that there is no serious common method bias in the sample data. Furthermore, VIF is tested and all the values of VIF as reported in Table 5 are between 1.355 and 2.328, all less than five, indicating that there is no serious multicollinearity problem of [ 118 ]. 4.2. Measurement model The measurement model was analysed before we modeling the inter- relationships of the latent constructs in SEM. We checked the Cronbach ’ s alpha using SPSS 28 and the composite reliability (CR) using AMOS 28 to assess the reliability of the questionnaire. Table 6 shows the results of Cronbach ’ s alpha and CR. All the Cronbach ’ s alpha and CR values were more than 0.7. These results meet the requirement for reliability and internal consistency for each latent construct [ 119 ]. Three types of validity were used to assess the validity of the items in the measurement model. The average variance extracted (AVE) and factor loading were used to assess convergent validity. In Table 3, all AVE values were greater than 0.5, and all factor loadings of each item were greater than 0.6, indicating that convergent validity was achieved [ 120 ]. We used AMOS to conduct the CFA. In the pooled CFA results, ChiSq//d ƒ = 1.729 < 3, CFI = 0.958 > 0.9, and RMSEA = 0.046 < 0.08, meet the requirement for model fitness The results indicated the construct validity is achieved. We employed the Fornell-Larcker crite- rion to assess the discriminant validity. The results are summarised in Table 7. The correlation between the constructs was smaller than the square root of the AVE represented in the same column, indicating that the measurement model met the requirements of discriminant validity [ 121 ]. 4.3.

Findings This study explores the impact of digital infrastructure and the reg- ulatory environment on organisational digital innovation. The findings show that digital infrastructure is positively related to digital innova- tion, thereby supporting H1 within the conceptual framework. This result is consistent with the previous research [ 64, 122 ], confirming that digital infrastructure is the core competitiveness of maintaining inno- vation in the digital ecosystem [ 123 ]. It enables the design of new products and services, enhances the ability to acquire enterprise infor- mation, and expands the boundaries of enterprise innovation [ 124 ], thereby promoting organisational digital innovation. This finding pro- vides evidence that digital infrastructure construction that outside en- terprises can impact organisational digital innovation. Compared with traditional infrastructure, digital infrastructure includes digital tech- nologies and intelligent platforms that break the boundaries of enter- prise design, R & D, production, sales and other links, and can provide the necessary technical resources for enterprises ’ digital innovation activities. The findings of this research show that in the digital era, the regu- latory environment also has a direct impact on organisational digital innovation, including policies that related to data elements, the digital market and digital talents and relevant regulatory measures regulating digital market competitions. Thus, H 2 in the conceptual framework is supported, which is compatible with previous literature [ 125, 126 ]. Government subsidies and tax incentives can effectively incentivise relevant enterprises to carry out digital innovation activities through financial subsidies such as loan discounts, project subsidies, and Table 6 Reliability and validity.

The findings also show that both digital infrastructure and the reg- ulatory environment are positively and indirectly related to digital innovation through data flow, thus supporting H3, H4 and H5. The construction of digital infrastructure can provide a technical foundation and promote the spread of data elements, which will promote organ- isational digital innovation. Existing research reports that digital infra- structure can support design, production, and even products and services across organisations and their value chains and that digital platforms and ecosystems can share more data and processes across organisational boundaries [ 60, 127 ] and allow information to travel across spatial distances [ 58 ]. Thus, the construction of digital infra- structure can boost data flows within the digital innovation ecosystem. Governments are an important component of the digital innovation ecosystem. The development and implementation of digital-related regulations by governments to create a regulatory environment for various innovative activities in the digital innovation ecosystem affect the mobility and security of data flow within the ecosystem. The bootstrap results confirm the mediating effect of data flows, supporting H6 and H7. Existing research on the role of data flows be- tween external factors and organisational digital innovation focuses only on conceptual and theoretical perspectives, and there is still a lack of empirical research. The results of this study provide evidence of the mediating role of data flows from the perspective of the digital inno- vation ecosystem. The flow and deformation of data elements have the potential to generate new value and innovative applications. Data flows within the digital innovation ecosystem in the form of innovation ele- ments, thereby activating, connecting, and aggregating the innovation activities of multiple subjects. Digital infrastructure, as a ‘highway ’ for data flow, facilitates the flow of innovation elements and intellectual capital within and between enterprises. The formulation and imple- mentation of policies related to the digital economy enabled data to flow within the ecosystem, thereby encouraging enterprises to actively carry out digital transformation. In turn, the flow of data elements can pro- mote the effective transmission of information between the market and government and between government departments so that the govern- ment can better provide services for relevant enterprises, and the rele- vant policies of the digital economy can better release the incentive energy for innovation, thereby stimulating the digital innovation of enterprises. This result is consistent with existing research [ 128 ], which confirms that by establishing a reasonable intellectual property protec- tion mechanism and fair market access rules, digital innovation achievements can be protected and more enterprises and individuals can be incentivised to participate in innovation activities. 5.2. Theoretical contributions First, this study considers digital infrastructure and the regulatory environment as the external environment from the perspective of the digital innovation ecosystem and explores the flow of data elements as a link between the external environment and the behaviour of innovation subjects, enriching the research on innovation ecosystem theory. In contrast to most existing studies based on internal business and man- agement aspects [ 31 – 34 ], this study combines research on the theory of the digital innovation ecosystem with the unique characteristics of digital innovation activities. This includes the organisation, elements, and technology, with a focus on the impact of external factors on en- terprise digital innovation activities, and take data elements as inno- vation elements in the digital innovation ecosystem to explore the mediating effect of data flows on the relationship between digital infrastructure, the regulatory environment, and digital innovation. The results of this study show that the sound construction of digital infra- structure and the support of the government in the regulatory environ- ment play a direct role in promoting the digital innovation activities of enterprises, which can encourage innovation subjects to carry out digital innovation activities from the outside and helps solve the problem of insufficient subjective initiative of innovation subjects to carry out digital innovation to a certain extent. Second, most of existing research on the digital innovation ecosystem focuses on the theoretical analysis of the connotations and approaches of digital innovation, and there is a lack of empirical sup- port. The findings provide empirical evidence for digital innovation ecosystem theory. Moreover, the construction and governance of digital ecosystems in the Chinese context deserve in-depth study. If digital innovation ecosystems are regarded as adaptive systems in complex environments, then the Chinese context is fertile ground for exploring theories related to the construction and governance of digital innovation ecosystems. On the one hand, China ’ s institutional environment and market environment are extremely complex and special [ 38 ]. On the other hand, exploring the construction and governance of digital inno- vation ecosystems in the Chinese context, contributes to existing the- ories and guides Chinese management practices. Moreover, most existing digital innovation-related studies use second-hand data provided by government agencies or investigating organisations and employ data such as the number of patented in- ventions to characterise digital innovation.

{"page_content": "Technology in Society 81 (2025) 102802 11 enterprises that invest in digital innovation are rare and challenging. This study introduces digital infrastructure, the regulatory environment, and data flows into the framework of research on digital innovation, employes a quantitative survey to collect data from China, and identifies the external factors that influence organizational digital innovation and the mechanisms of their impact. 5.3. Practical contributions First, the results of this study show that sound digital infrastructure and a supportive regulatory environment play a direct role in promoting the digital innovation activities of enterprises and stimulating the will- ingness of innovation subjects to carry out digital innovation activities from external factors. To some extent, this can help overcome the insufficient motivation for enterprises conducting digital innovation to a certain extent. This study can provide a decision-making basis for en- terprises by identifying the external environment that affects organisa- tional digital innovation. Enterprises could explore and seize the favorable factors in the institutional environment in a timely manner, which is the key to obtaining the expected benefits of digital innovation. For internet enterprises, which have the leading advantage of digital background, the results of this research can help them achieve vertical collaboration with local traditional industries, such as implementing industrial Internet or ‘Internet + manufacturing ’. For traditional in- dustries, such as farming and manufacturing, the results can help en- terprises carry out digital transformation and help latecomers catch up with opportunities by focusing on the cultivation of digital-related ca- pabilities and readiness. Therefore, this study can provide a decision- making reference for the conducting innovation activities of internet- based enterprises, implementing digital transformation of traditional enterprises, and the development of emerging and future industries, motivate innovation subjects to increase digital innovation output, enhance the collaborative development of enterprises in the digital innovation ecosystem, and improve the competitiveness of enterprises. Second, the results show that the flow of data elements significantly promotes digital innovation, and the external environment can also indirectly affect digital innovation activities through data flow. This conclusion highlights the importance of data flows and provides theo- retical guidance for governments to explore and formulate relevant policies and regulations to promote the flow of data elements, thereby releasing the value of data elements and creating a regulatory envi- ronment for the benign flow of data. To improve the flow environment of regional data elements, policymakers should strengthen the con- struction of regional digital infrastructure, formulate a comprehensive and systematic development plan for the flow of data elements, strengthen the standardisation of supporting facilities such as market laws and regulations, establish a platform for data element trading and open sharing, promote the safe and efficient flow of data elements, and stimulate initiative digital innovation within enterprises. On the one hand, it is necessary to strengthen regional digital infrastructure, rationally plan and deploy digital infrastructure according to the char- acteristics of different regions and industries, and improve the coverage and applicability of digital infrastructure. New-generation information technologies such as 5G, cloud computing, and big data should be pro- moted; the level and coverage of digital infrastructure improved; and the necessary technical support and guarantees for the value of data ele- ments provided. On the other hand, the establishment of data element trading and open sharing platforms, focusing on the development of the digital economy and the wide regional radiation driving effect of the region, and the construction of industry characteristics of the industry data trading platform can promote the integration and sharing of data in the industry. Platforms should be interconnected and move beyond regional and industry barriers. This would include unified data trans- action circulation rules, perhaps with a unified national quotation and decentralised transaction data trading venue system. Simultaneously, with the rapid growth of digital innovation, the overall intensity of government subsidies for digital innovation should be increased, and financial resources should be used to leverage digital enterprises ’ own R & D investments and social capital supplements to form a diversified innovation investment system. 5.4. Limitation Considering the availability of data, this study used the convenience sampling method to collect samples, which has some shortcomings: first, the researcher ’ s work area is one of the most developed regions in China ’ s digital economy, and with the support of favorable factors such as a broader space for digital development in the region and an exem- plary and leading role of digital benchmarking enterprises, it is easier for enterprises to achieve positive results in digital innovation. However, in fact, there are great differences in the development of the digital econ- omy in different regions of China, and future research can divide the digital development level of enterprises in the regions where enterprises are located into high, medium and low levels, and compare the char- acteristics of digital innovation of enterprises at different levels, as well as the differences in the role of the external environment on the digital innovation of enterprises to explore new discoveries. Second, the total sample size is small, and an attempt should be made to expand the sample size in the future to enhance the reliability and accuracy of the research", "metadata": {"producer": "Acrobat Distiller 8.1.0 (Windows)", "creator": "Elsevier", "creationdate": "2025-04-26T11:38:27+00:00", "crossmarkdomains[1]": "elsevier.com", "crossmarkmajorversiondate": "2010-04-23", "creationdate--text": "26th April 2025", "elsevierwebpdfspecifications": "7.0.1", "robots": "noindex", "moddate": "2025-04-26T11:46:17+00:00", "author": "Yue Xia", "doi": "10.1016/j.techsoc.2024.102802", "keywords": "Organisational digital innovation,Digital innovation ecosystem,Data flows,Digital infrastructure,Regulatory environment", "title": "How external factors influence organisational digital innovation: Evidence from China", "subject": "Technology in Society, 81 (2025) 102802. doi:10.1016/j.techsoc.2024.102802", "crossmarkdomains[2]": "sciencedirect.com", "crossmarkdomainexclusive": "true", "source": "data\\How-external-factors-influence-organisational-digital-inn_2025_Technology-in.pdf", "total_pages": 15, "page": 10, "page_label": "11", "start_index": 0}}

As this study is limited to enterprises in China, samples from other countries or regions and larger sample size can be taken to cross check this relationship in future investigations. Third, digital innovation is developing quickly, and new influencing factors and mechanisms could be investigated. 6. Conclusion These findings provide evidence that the external environment, such as digital infrastructure and the regulatory environment, directly and indirectly affects organisational digital innovation. Data flows within the digital innovation ecosystem connects the external environment to innovative activities. The flow of data elements is limited by the digital infrastructure and regulatory environment, which also influence organisational digital innovation. Digital infrastructure can provide the necessary technical resources for enterprises ’ digital innovation activ- ities and promote the flow of knowledge and innovation elements within and between organisations. The regulatory environment around data flows has a vital impact on the mobility and security of data elements and ultimately influences organisational digital innovation. The findings and conclusions of this study can provide guidance for enterprises to successfully transform and achieve digital innovation performance using digital technologies, and can also provide a basis for government decision-making such as restrictions on cross-border data flows. 2 CRediT authorship contribution statement Yue Xia: Writing – review & editing, Writing – original draft, Methodology, Funding acquisition, Formal analysis, Data curation, Conceptualization.

However, empirical analysis of interactions between leadership networks and new artificial intelligence-driven technologies is scarce. To shed new light on leadership communities around the adoption of an existing and a new technology related to leadership networks, we analyze the level of socio-digital engagement of a non-hierarchical network of individuals associated with a prestigious Spanish Foundation in the context of pressing social challenges. We apply a methodology that combines quantitative and qualitative methods, sentiment analysis, and insider research to analyze the strategy applied by the Foundation. Our main results show that the existence of strong, trust-based relationships and the introduction of a well-designed AI-based tool may only have a limited effect on the adoption of technology and the evolution of a network. Specifically, in the case studied, the network of leaders around the Foundation comprised peer leadership networks but not collective leadership networks focused on action on social challenges. 1. Introduction In a world facing urgent challenges, increasing the collective intel - ligence of social and innovation leaders seems especially relevant [ 1 ] to solve complex problems and make informed decisions. In this sense, fast technological advances in various topics such as advanced robotics, blockchain, artificial intelligence (AI), 1 and big data have become the focus of many public policies around the world [ 2, 3 ] and are revolutionizing the way firms and individuals interact and address urgent social challenges, as recently evidenced by the Covid pandemic [ 4 – 6 ]. In particular, social networking is an activity that has been completely transformed in the digital age with the appearance of social media and social networking platforms that are pervasive and play a dominant role in fostering connections and communication between individuals and groups [ 7 – 9 ]. At the same time, we expect the evolution of social networks to be further revolutionized when combined with AI [ 10 ] which can enhance interaction experiences and yield important benefits [ 1 ]. However, it is foreseeable that the potential drawbacks of intertwining social networks and AI in terms of privacy [ 11 ], security, biases, and psychological and/or sociological changes in behavior will need to be addressed [ 12 ]. In this fast changing environment, the development of collective intelligence and action [ 13 ] and the nurturing and catalyzation of non-hierarchic leadership networks [ 14 ] are becoming important issues, as these provide resources and support to business, academic, and po - litical leaders acting in different social spheres and increase their po - tential impact in terms of both scope and scale [ 15 ]. Despite this, empirical research analyzing these types of networks and their evolution in the digital and AI era is still scarce. * Corresponding author. E-mail addresses: oihana.basilio@uam.es (O.

{"page_content": "In light of the above, this study analyzes the level of socio-digital engagement among members of the non-hierarchical leadership net - works associated with a prestigious Spanish Foundation (hereafter, the Foundation) dedicated to the training of leaders and the creation of a leadership community. We highlight that the Foundation has equipped these members with a self-developed AI-based social networking tool for collective action and to address urgent social challenges. For this purpose, we apply a methodology that combines quantita - tive and qualitative methods to analyze the interactions between leaders in the networks, including sentiment analysis and research from within the Foundation. The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 provides a literature review on the key issues related to the research. Section 3 describes the methodology, providing information about the case study and the specific methods applied to analyze social interactions, while section 4 presents the results of the analysis. Section 5 focuses on the discussion of results and section 6 on the conclusions. 2. Literature review 2.1. Technology adoption Technological adoption has been widely studied from different per - spectives within scientific literature, with a prevalence over the last decades for evolutionary theories and perspectives explaining how agents adapt and evolve in response to changing environments. On the one hand, we find extent seminal literature analyzing technological change, trajectories and patterns of innovation [ 16, 17 ], macro processes of technology adoption and diffusion [ 18 ] and other technology adop - tion patterns affecting sectors [ 19, 20 ], countries, and regions [ 21 ]. Recent literature has also made important contributions, analyzing the cumulative effects of technological complexity [ 2, 3 ], the governance and regulatory challenges of new technology adoption [ 3 ], and the adoption patterns of specific technologies [ 22 ], including adoption in sectors specially affected by ethical concerns, such as medicine [ 23 ]. On the other hand, at the micro level and specifically from a managerial perspective, some authors have emphasized that the pat - terns of adoption of these technologies are complex and subject to a wide range of socio-technical factors, including interpretations [ 24 ], emotional aspects [ 25 ], and perceptions of existing barriers and in - centives [ 26 ]. For example, potential users of a technology may expe - rience ambiguity about the value that using such technologies brings to their work and lives [ 27 ] or may experience other feelings related to trust dynamics, such as apprehension or mistrust [ 28–30 ]. This second group of studies have explored the processes and factors affecting technology acceptance by users and organizations [ 31–34 ], giving rise to the emergence of diverse valuable models and theories [ 35 ]. According to the technology acceptance model (TAM), system design features, perceived usefulness, and perceived ease of use appear as primary drivers of technology use [ 36 ]. Subsequently, Venkatesh et al. [ 35 ] formulated a unified theory of acceptance and use of tech - nology (UTAUT) that includes performance expectancy, effort expec - tancy, social influence, and facilitating conditions as direct determinants. More recently, with the introduction of new technologies such as AI, blockchain, robotics, and platform technologies [ 37 ], research has focused on understanding the unique challenges that affect their adop - tion [ 38 ], including those related to the appearance of network effects and learning curves [ 39 ], to the influence of organizational size and digital capabilities [ 40 ], and to the impact of their adoption on net job creation or destruction [ 41 ]. Moreover, increasing the complexity of adoption patterns at the micro level, the usages of many of these new technologies are often intertwined. For instance, AI, which is dedicated to the analysis of various data to improve decision-making in both the public and the private sector [ 42 ], is often complementary with blockchain, a decentralized digital ledger technology that stores data securely, immutably, transparently, and without intermediaries [ 43, 44 ], allowing AI to be more secure and reliable and data to be used privately [ 45 ]. In turn, advanced robotics is made possible using AI, as it enables robots to perform versatile, complex, and adaptive activities [ 46 ], and hence be used in highly advanced and delicate tasks, such as those carried in hospitals to monitor and develop new surgical methods [ 47 ]. Another example of the practical combination of these technologies and their impact on social challenges is their use for improving agricultural methods and encouraging the sustainability of such methods [ 48 ]. Similarly, and as already stated, the increasing introduction of social media and networking platforms in combination with AI-based tech - nologies has raised new specific concerns [ 49, 50 ] affecting the adoption and acceptance of such platforms [ 51 ] and justifying the need for further research in this area of knowledge. 2.2.

Social and collective leadership networks Collaboration and knowledge sharing have been widely accepted as key activities for innovation [ 52 ]. In this sense, over the last decades, multinational companies have spent substantial amounts of money on the creation of information systems for collaboration and the creation of physical and virtual spaces for formal and informal networking and knowledge sharing [ 26, 29, 53, 54 ]. Research acknowledging the key importance of tacit and sticky knowledge has emphasized the impor - tance of the dialogue and sense-making that occurs through active networking [ 55 ], in which explicit and tacit knowledge held by in - dividuals, teams, and organizations is exchanged [ 56, 57 ]. As people who make up a network often belong to organizations with different knowledge domains, values, interests, and norms [ 58–60 ], this dialogue can lead to strengthening of the network and of innovation, but also create various barriers to collaboration. A prolific thread of the literature has devoted attention to the anal - ysis of networks and of the characteristics that affect knowledge sharing, including silos, culture clashes, or competing priorities [ 61, 62 ]. In this regard, literature states that it is easier to transfer all kinds of knowledge through strong ties (i.e., personal ties with a strong emotional attach - ment or frequent communication that helps develop trust) and that these types of strong ties are more difficult to develop than weaker ties, as they require greater investments of time and hence involve higher costs [ 63 ]. Complementarily, trust building is one of the most crucial elements for the mobilization of knowledge resources within networks, as it has a significant direct effect on the strength of interpersonal ties [ 60, 64, 65 ]. Hansen and Løvås [ 66 ] state that, when seeking help, “teams may contact someone they know rather than someone who knows” (p.806), as knowledge exchanges are influenced by friendship ties and social networks. In contrast, interorganizational and interpersonal competi - tion are negatively associated with knowledge exchange and collabo - ration [ 65 ]. Another group of authors has focused on the analysis of interpersonal networks from a systemic perspective, changing the focus from the in - dividual to cliques and communities, and reconceptualizing a system from the idea of interrelated actors to an idea of interrelated roles [ 67 ]. From this perspective, although interpersonal ties are important for knowledge circulation, it is key to analyze the cumulative effects of in - dividual and group learning [ 68 ]. Communities increase the potential for creativity and innovation (including social) and, through mutual engagement and joint endeavor, they can increase the ethical commitments of individuals and their willingness to contribute and share knowledge rising above self-interest, even in those cases when personal incentives are negligible and there is no expectation of future rewards [ 69 ]. In fact, within communities, in - teractions between agents participating in a network create unantici - pated behaviors and emergent patterns at the collective level (collective behavior). Coherent with this systemic understanding of networks, some O. Basilio Ruiz de Apodaca et al.

{"page_content": "authors identify leadership as a collective rather than an individual behavior [ 70 ], and hence consider that leadership cannot be studied independently from the system or from the collective behavior [ 71 ]. In this sense, collective leadership networks (CLN) are especially impor - tant, being defined as “self-organized system[s] of social ties among people attracted to a common cause or focused on a shared goal … often rooted in a sense of community and purpose” [ 15 ] (p.601). These networks provide leaders with resources and support to in - crease their potential impact in terms of both reach and scale. They can be developed from scratch or as an evolution of a peer leadership network (PLN), defined as “a system of social ties among leaders who are connected through shared interests and commitments, shared work, or shared experiences”, in which leaders share information, provide advice and support, learn from one another and, only occasionally, collaborate with each other for a common objective [ 15 ] (p.601). A concept related to leadership networks is collective intelligence, understood as the overall ability of a group to perform a variety of tasks [ 72 ], considering that the group of people should be more efficient than the same people working in isolation and that diversity is beneficial to the group’s performance [ 73 ]. From a perspective more associated with the digital age, a collective intelligence system allows the knowledge, experience, and resources of thousands of people to be gathered in an interactive process to solve complex problems and address challenging issues [ 74 ]. Combining the need to understand the patterns of adoption of the mentioned new technologies and their effects on collaboration with collective intelligence and decision-making, a more recent field of research has focused on understanding the characteristics that increase the collective intelligence of a group or network (e.g., diversity, inde - pendence, decentralization), and on how new technology, and specif - ically AI, enhances these cognitive capabilities, collective decision- making [ 75 ], collective action [ 13 ] and the potential to address important social challenges [ 76 ]. In this sense, literature has revealed the potential of AI to drive economic growth, reduce poverty, fight climate change, improve healthcare and address public health issues, and address urban planning, public safety, and education challenges [ 77 ] and has proposed guide - lines for successful collaboration in addressing the challenges of implementing socially beneficial AI projects [ 78 ]. However, there is still little research that addresses this issue from an empirical perspective, linking the concepts of technology adoption, AI-driven collaboration, collective intelligence, and the evolution of leadership networks to address urgent social challenges [ 79 ]. 3. Methods and context In line with some authors who suggest that case studies of leadership networks can help us understand how networks evolve [ 15, 80 ], our overall objective is to analyze the level of socio-digital engagement of the non-hierarchical network of individuals associated with a presti - gious Spanish Foundation in the context of urgent social challenges, considering the participation and emotions conveyed by them via WhatsApp and the subsequent introduction of an AI-based platform. 3.1. The case study unit and its context The selected Spanish Foundation is relevant for analyzing the in - fluence of the quality of relationships and interactions on technology adoption and the development of leadership networks for different reasons. Firstly, it is a recognized non-profit institution that creates leadership in Spain and, since 2015, has implemented a strategy to develop leadership networks and communities of leaders focused on the common good, as particularly shown in this study. Secondly, it has co- developed and launched a new AI-based tool for social networking and collective intelligence for this purpose (see Appendix 1 ). Thirdly, the availability of internal data about the strategy and the outcome of the implemented action allows a deep understanding of the case, and the unique character of the group of leaders accessed makes this a singular case for understanding leadership networks and their evolution. Fourthly, the networks and communities analyzed have been built around the idea of leadership for good, and the Foundation remains independent, having no contractual relationship with the leaders invited to participate in its programs and no governmental, political, or ideo - logical affiliation. Because of its unique character, leaders gathered around the Foun - dation have a strong sense of independence and feel supported by the organization to share their personal views on often conflictive topics. Hence, the created leadership networks and communities are not an asset of the institution, as it has no mechanisms of control over them or their members, and its strategic actions are directed toward creating value so that Spanish leaders can feel a personal benefit from engaging with the Foundation and its communities. Consequently, this case sheds new light on how leadership networks develop in a non-hierarchical environment. In particular, the analysis has focused on a specific community of leaders gathered around the innovation and entrepreneurship program (IEP) organized by the Foundation.

Consequently, this case sheds new light on how leadership networks develop in a non-hierarchical environment. In particular, the analysis has focused on a specific community of leaders gathered around the innovation and entrepreneurship program (IEP) organized by the Foundation. Since 2016, this program has brought together every year, for five days, between 30 and 50 Spanish participants ( Table 1 ) carefully selected through suggestions from former program participants, who attend a top-level training course at the prestigious MIT Sloan (Cambridge, MA, US). Since its creation, around 240 leaders—including public innovation procurers, Chief Innovation Officers of large corporations, entrepreneurs, scientists, ac - ademics, and other relevant practitioners in the field of innovation and entrepreneurship—have attended the program. Each annual IEP has allowed the creation of a pre-existing network of leaders that share interests and experiences, exchange information and support, and occasionally collaborate for a common objective. The continuity of the network after the program is facilitated by the WhatsApp group created for each cohort at the beginning of the program ( Table 1 ). After the third program (in 2018), and with the objective of consolidating the IEP community and making it evolve toward a CLN, the Foundation decided to develop and introduce an AI-based social networking tool, which was carefully designed in order to comply with diverse socio-technical criteria that could predictably affect leaders’ acceptance of the technology. The tool was launched in September 2021, inviting the 240 leaders of the IEP community (the six cohorts together) to join the AI-based platform for collective intelligence ( Table 1 ). Analysis of this initiative is especially interesting as the design and development of the tool was actually facilitated by some leaders of the IEP community, answering the concerns of the Foundation and its wish to contribute to the common good. 3.2. Methodological steps In order to reach the overall objective, we set two specific objectives. The first objective is to know whether the quality of the relationships of each cohort making up the pre-existing non-hierarchical leadership Table 1 IEP community.

{"page_content": "network associated with the Foundation achieves the status of a peer leadership network. To achieve this specific objective, we first measured the intensity of the interactions between the leaders belonging to each network. We emphasize that higher intensity of interactions is associated with stronger trust and tends to facilitate the transfer of all types of knowl - edge [ 65, 81 ]. In this case, the intensity of the interactions within the networks was measured by counting the number of interactions (comments made by the participating leaders) in each of the six WhatsApp groups corre - sponding to each IEP cohort. For this purpose, 10,760 interactions from the chats of each group, dated from the date of their creation ( Table 1 ) until January 13, 2022, were analyzed. An index of the intensity of interactions was created for each IEP cohort ( Interaction IEPcohort ) in order to consider the different years since creation of the groups, from the most recent (one year) to the oldest (six years), and the different number of participants in each group. Interaction IEPcohort = number of total interactions number of participants * years since creation (Eq. 1) If the result of the Interaction IEPcohort index is at least equal to 1, it means that the number of interactions annually is at least equal to the number of participants. A result of less than 1 indicates that the number of interactions per year is lower than the number of participants. Secondly, the typology of predominant emotions and moods shared within each network was measured by analyzing the emotions conveyed by the emojis used in the WhatsApp conversations according to their association with specific emotions. Literature has shown that emojis portray emotions in an unambiguous manner, independent of the domain and the topic of the conversation [ 82 ]. Moreover, the meaning of emojis has been found to remain relatively stable across different languages and media [ 83 ]. Hence, a sentiment analysis allows us to observe the vibes of communications occurring in reality within the networks without the biases expected from direct surveys about perceptions. For this purpose, we reviewed the archival records of each WhatsApp group and counted the total number of times that a specific emoji (x) appears, considering all interactions since the creation of the group. In order to characterize each network in terms of the predominant emotions, we created an index of intensity of emotions for each IEP cohort ( Emotion IEPcohort ) by relating the total number of appearances of an emotion-intense emoji in relation to the number of participants and years since creation. Emotions IEPcohort = number of time an emoji appears ( x ) number of participants * years since creation (Eq. 2) We emphasize that if the result of the Emotions IEPcohort index is at least equal to 1, it means at least one emotion-intense emoji for each partic - ipant each year. A result of less than 1 indicates that the number of emotion-intense emojis used is lower than the number of participants. Following Mohta et al. [ 82 ], we codified the emojis into six basic emotions — happy (joy), sad, angry, fearful, excited, and bored 2 — and classified them in the two dimensions or scales suggested by Russell [ 84 ] in his circumplex model of affect: valence (degree of pleasur - e/displeasure) and arousal (level of activation/deactivation). Additional emotions (i.e., disgust, surprise, and trust), used by Awal et al. [ 85 ], were added to the codification in order to enrich the sentiment analysis and to adapt it to the emojis used by leaders in the analyzed context ( Appendix 2 ). For codification, we distinguished three categories of emojis by unifying them in the quadrants of Russell ’ s [ 84 ] circumplex model of affect: 1) high valence (pleasure) and high arousal (activation); 2) low valence (displeasure) and high arousal (activation); and 3) low valence (displeasure) and low arousal (deactivation). The final list of the emojis used for the codification of interactions by leaders and their categori - zation into Russell ’ s [ 84 ] quadrants is shown in Table 2: the remaining emotion-intense emojis did not appear in the analyzed conversations. Insights gained into the strength of interactions with the analysis of emojis were reinforced with qualitative insights gained through direct participant observation during the training programs and the different initiatives organized by the Foundation (e.g., annual gatherings), and with an additional codification of the WhatsApp messages containing textual feedback and expressions of gratitude (i.e., the word “ Gracias ” ), portraying more stable sentiments than emotions [ 86 ].

Complementa - rily, we qualitatively observed the typologies of issues shared by leaders through WhatsApp. The second specific objective is to explore whether the leadership network, supported by the Foundation (which works together only oc - casionally), can become a more impactful and action-oriented CLN, primarily considering the introduction of a new AI-based tool. For this purpose, we first confirmed that the AI-based tool that was subsequently launched is well-designed in terms of its system design features, after analyzing internal documents related to the technology development project, considering a document describing the technical and architectural features of the tool; a document containing reflections and notes on the project taken by the director of the Foundation, including discussions held with the technology developers (copy-pasted from the WhatsApp group created with them); and the promotional video created for the IEP network, which portrayed the purpose of the tool and the creation of the mission-oriented community. Secondly, we obtained records of downloads of the app (or the AI- based platform) by the 240 leaders of the different cohorts of the IEP who were invited to use it, as well as actual use of the platform, considering the period from the launch of the app in September 2021 to March 2022, when the app records were downloaded. The analysis of these data was based on identification of the platform users by their IEP cohort of origin, which allowed us to establish a link between the characterization of each pre-existing network and the adoption of the platform by leaders of each network. Thirdly, we analyzed the kick-off activities promoted by the Foun - dation to seed the network and to generate initial critical content and engagement around specific challenges. To do this, we specifically analyzed participation in the different thematic tables created by the Foundation around specific challenges of interest suggested by the Foundation itself and by the leaders. We analyzed the app records regarding leaders ’ explicit willingness to contribute to the different challenges: they could state whether they were willing to contribute with their time, financial resources, connections, or other personal re - sources to collectively find solutions. Finally, we also considered the assessment made by the leaders of the Foundation regarding the use of the new app and the behavior of the participants in relation to the social challenges posed in the thematic groups. We emphasize that it is an advantage that data generation for this study was facilitated by the authors ’ unique access to internal sources of the Foundation, 3 both as participants and as observers of the analyzed initiatives, which are only accessible to trusted insiders of the analyzed communities and which provide deep and rich understanding of the case. 2 Since our analysis is only interested in emotion-intense interactions, we do not consider emotion-neutral emojis included by Mohta et al. (2020) nor anticipation by Awal et al. [ 85 ]. 3 Most of the authors were in executive leading positions at the Foundation and involved in the design and implementation of the analyzed strategy and initiatives. O.

Results Regarding results related to the first specific objective, analysis of the intensity of interactions in the WhatsApp groups of each IEP ( Table 3 ) shows that approximately half of the interactions take place in the year in which the IEP is implemented and that all participants in each pro - gram use the WhatsApp groups created by the Foundation. In turn, the intensity of interactions index has an average result of 14.27, which is clearly above the critical number of the indicator (1) and is even higher for the networks of years 2018, 2019, and 2020. The sentiment analysis within the WhatsApp groups corresponding to each network ( Table 4 ) shows that the index of intensity of emotions for all cohorts but 2016 was higher than its critical number (1). How - ever, the highest intensity of emotions occurred in the 2018 and 2019 programs. In turn, analysis of the categories of emotions ( Table 4 ) shows a predominance of the category composed by high valence and high arousal, which is also much higher for the IEP cohorts of the years 2017, 2018, and 2019. 4 In addition, observation of the interactions occurring among par - ticipants in each IEP over the years, both through their WhatsApp groups and during other encounters at the Foundation, confirms that participants share various resources, support each other, engage in bonding and networking activities, have common interests (also considering that this was a pre-requisite in their selection process and participation in the IEP), and discuss and reflect on various topics, but only occasionally collaborate with a higher level of engagement. Regarding results related to the second specific objective, first of all, the analysis reveals that the team in charge of the design of the system took into account many critical socio-technical issues which were considered to be important for users. Table 5 describes the most important socio-technical system design features included in the AI tool. Socio-technical issues relevant for acceptance and adoption of the technology were not only considered by the Foundation in the design and development phase of the tool, but also in the ways it communicated the vision that it pursued with its launch. In this sense, other aspects related to social influence were also taken into consideration, specif - ically through the promotional video shown in the encounter organized for the IEP community. In particular, questions related to image, mutual engagement, and the building of a common identity were considered by the Foundation, as the following paragraph evidences. This is an extract from the inspirational video shown to the IEP community before the launch of the tool that aimed at motivating its adoption by creating an inspiring vision for the common good: Massive impact happens when communities self-organize around a shared purpose to understand the challenges we are facing (…). In the past, networking was a matter of time and luck (travel, events, meetings, bumping into each other), but now networking will be a matter of data. Welcome to (the AI-based platform), a tool to leverage our collective intelligence (…); (it) offers relevant connections (symmetric, mutually desired, endorsed by people you trust, complementary, with strong pur - pose alignment, protecting your privacy). Only a few minutes per week to receive unprecedented and personalized insights. After the event, the Director of the Foundation received a lot of personal messages and feedback (including face-to-face statements, personal WhatsApps, and emails) from leaders expressing their intention to join the app and collaborate with the rest of the community to solve social challenges. Subsequently, a pilot was launched in December 2021, inviting the 240 leaders forming the IEP community (all six cohorts of the editions of the program) to join the AI-based platform. Moreover—and in order to accelerate the learning curve and overcome adoption barriers—some initial activities were organized, such as ‘fast dates’ for leaders to know each other by means of the tool, or the creation of ‘kick off’ events and specific ‘tables’ around various topics in order to seed the network, create a clearer proposition, and generate content and incentives for participation. In addition, individualized user support was provided in order to make the leaders feel they were being taken care of by the Foundation. Considering all the analyzed system design features and the actions taken by the Foundation, we believe that the developed technology is sufficiently well-designed. However, results of the analysis of registers provided by the app about the adoption of the technology show a rather low level of acceptance of the new AI-based social networking and collective intel - ligence tool ( Table 6 ). Records provided by the app reveal that, among the 240 invited leaders, only 93 downloaded the app (38.8 percent of the network), in contrast to the 99.2 percent of leaders that were still part of the diverse WhatsApp groups by August 2024.

Moreover, among these 92 leaders, only 56 were real users of the tool in practice (23.3 %), meaning that they not only downloaded the app but also interact with the technology—for example, by joining some of the tables around specific topics. Analyzing adoption of the app by IEP cohorts, the results show that although acceptance of the tool and adoption of the technology can be found in all networks, there are important differences among them in the degree of participation. In particular, the cohorts of the 2018 and 2019 editions of the program showed a higher percentage of actual users (7 percentage points above the mean adoption rate), while only 8.3 percent of leaders in the oldest network participated. Regarding participants’ willingness to contribute to specific chal - lenges aiming at collective action, records provided by the app evi - denced modest engagement by participants. In this sense, the most successful thematic table in the app, registering the highest number of leaders, was the one called \"Work of the Future\", which attracted 40 leaders (71 percent of app users), followed by the topics \"Digital Inclu - sion\" (37 %), \"Hospital of the Future\" (30 %), and \"The Future of Edu - cation\" (25 %). The AI-based tool also allowed participants to express the type of contribution they were willing to make to the group: this represented different levels of engagement and hence depth of collaboration with the Table 2 Emojis used for codification of intensity of emotion.

{"page_content": "network and the selected social challenge. Taking as an illustrative example the case of the most successful topic (the table on the work of the future), we observed that the most sought-after typologies of con - tributions were those that required a lower level of engagement or compromise, namely the contribution of ideas (55 percent of partici - pants) and experience (40 %). In contrast, those options requiring higher personal cost or involvement were less attractive to participants, namely sharing contacts (22.5 %), time/work (20 %), or investment and assets (10 %). Finally, a self-analysis of the development of the initiative and the lessons learned by the Foundation ’ s own leaders suggests that the new network of leaders was not able to organize itself and, hence, the Foundation should have provided additional support to boost partici - pation of leaders. According to the Foundation, this situation also evi - dences the difficulties leaders found in devoting time to activities alongside their key responsibilities at their origin organizations, and hence the complexities of promoting the creation of non-hierarchic collective leadership networks. 5. Discussion The emergence of strong and pro-active leadership that aims at solving urgent social challenges through innovation and collective ac - tion seems crucial in our fast-changing world. However, understanding how to promote the evolution of such networks, from a less action- oriented leadership network toward a more action-oriented commu - nity, in a non-hierarchic and extra-organizational context is not straightforward. Moreover, it is not yet clear how AI-based tools for social networking can assist in the evolution of such networks and how these tools will be adopted by leaders. Through the case study of the strategy and actions implemented by a Spanish Foundation, we aimed at shedding new light on these issues. We consider that the selected methodology has been useful to characterize the strength of leaders ’ networks within a context, and to determine whether or not such networks enable action on urgent social challenges under certain management and circumstances. We believe that our study enriches the criteria for defining PLNs and CLNs, as we found evidence that the strategy pursued was successful in aligning the interests of various leaders around specific social challenges and actions, even allowing them to express their willingness to Table 3 Intensity of interactions within the WhatsApp groups.

{"page_content": "contribute to the cause with different resources (not only experience, but also time and effort). However, the level of self-organization of the network was limited and did not comply with CLN criteria [ 15 ]. Among the explanations we can find, the most relevant follow the so-called Occam’s razor because of its simplicity. Specifically, we believe firstly that the Foundation should have taken a stronger leadership role and carried out activities that allowed the participants in the different co - horts to get to know each other and strengthen their relationships face-to-face, as a community, in order to achieve greater interaction in the new app, greater collective intelligence, and greater self-organization in the search for concrete solutions to urgent social challenges. Secondly, we believe that the initiative did not comply with a key recommendation for successful adoption of AI for social good and collaboration—namely, that the goals and use cases should be clear and well-defined [ 78 ]. Using as a metaphor the tetrahedron of fire, essentially known by firefighters, in order to maintain the fire of an ignited community and release its collective intelligence, we believe it is necessary to have at the same time four elements that cannot be removed: the fuel (the collective need for and interest in solving societal challenges); the oxygen (the network of leaders willing to contribute with resources); and the heat or a spark with sufficient energy to ignite the fire (a specific action or initiative, such as the creation of a clear and well-structured problem to solve) and maintain a chain of reactions (i.e., a self-sustained collective action). In this metaphor, technology is just one of the possible locations in which collective action is ignited. We believe that in this case the spark that the pilot ignited was not sufficiently powerful. The following are some lessons learned from this case study that might be useful for policymakers or organizations similar to the Foun - dation to consider when seeking to establish a CLN to address social challenges. a. The leadership behind the desire to create a collective leadership network must be very strong at the beginning and oriented toward union and synergy to create a spark strong enough to identify and excite members according to the established purposes. b. The creation of an app must be a tool that is perceived as truly practical by the leaders who will use it to streamline solutions to social challenges. Finally, in terms of managerial implications, we believe that leaders have an individual incentive to join a leadership network in order to increase their social contacts and influence. In turn, the incentive to participate actively and proactively in these types of networks is prob - ably fundamentally linked to the possibility of improving their profes - sional results directly or indirectly (not necessarily in the short term). In this context, even though these individual leaders have an incentive to leverage and strengthen their relationships with leaders from different organizations and spheres of action (e.g., academics or high-level public officials) and are willing to contribute their time and resources to the social good, they probably need clearer information and instructions to be able to better fine-tune their personal cost vs. personal and social benefit equation. 6. Conclusions This study is based on non-hierarchical leadership networks made up of leaders from different sectors in Spain who have participated year after year in the Innovation and Entrepreneurship Program of an important Spanish Foundation. In the first phase, the networks were separated by WhatsApp groups linked to their cohorts in the IEP, but later, the new AI-based app created by the Foundation and other actions of the same organization allowed the different leaders to interact according to their topics of interest related to grand social challenges. In this context, we can conclude that the level of socio-digital engagement related to the urgent social challenges of the leadership networks was practically nil, since they only achieved the formation of peer leadership networks and not collective leadership networks focused on action, as desired by the Foundation. The analysis shows that the networks complied with the requisites of the peer leadership network category because all IEP participants interacted in the WhatsApp group corresponding to their cohort; the index of intensity of interactions and the index of intensity of emotions were above their critical levels in almost all cohorts; high valence and arousal emoticons predominated; and program participants managed to carry out activities to create and strengthen their bonds. However, despite the Foundation’s efforts, this study found that the network of leaders (considering all the cohorts as a single group, as a community) did not become a collective leadership network because they failed to self-organize [ 15 ]. This was evidenced by the fact that the app created by the Foundation did not reach a minimum critical mass to be actively used. Consequently, these results show that the Foundation should seek other strategies to achieve collective leadership networks with great collective intelligence in the face of urgent social challenges, and that these actions do not necessarily need to be organized by means of an app for collective intelligence.

The first toe of the AI tool In 2018, the Foundation brought together three IEP alumni (experts in new innovative technologies) and asked them to develop the tool, intro - ducing relevant features in its design to facilitate new connections among participants of different networks and lower the barriers for accepting the technology. The following images illustrate some of these features. Appendix 2Classification of emojis by emotions The following figure shows the classification of emojis according to the emotions of happiness, sadness, fear, anger, excitation, and boredom, along with neutrality, applied by Mohta et al. [ 82 ]. They were combined with the classification of emojis applied by Awal et al. [ 85 ] to account for additional emojis and emotions (in brackets). We also added emojis not considered by those authors (e.g., within excitation) and reclassified a few emojis according to their intended meaning in the analyzed context (e.g., for excitation and not for anger, or for surprise and not for fear).

It adopts both a narrow and broad understanding of bioinspired technology. In a narrower sense, it refers to technologies that mimic natural forms, structures, or functional principles, typically developed within the field of biomimetics. More broadly, bioinspired technologies are defined as those designed with human or non-human nature in mind and adapted to meet the needs of both. The Special Issue addresses five key questions: First, it asks how the broad spectrum of bioinspired technologies can be categorized and classified. Second, it explores the extent to which bioinspired technologies contribute to a sustainable future and in particular to the development of sustainable technologies and what criteria can be used to ensure the sustainability of bioinspired technologies. Third, it presents methods for investigating and fostering societal acceptance of new bioinspired technologies. Fourth, central technical and societal areas are considered in which bioinspiration can contribute to a sustainable future. Lastly, it explores the ontological and ethical challenges associated with bioinspired technologies in so far as they undermine the previous distinction between ‘nature ’ and ‘technology ’. 1. Introduction to the topic of the Special Issue The development of bioinspired technologies is an important part of the scientific and technical progress in the context of the challenges discussed under the term “ Anthropocene ” ( Crutzen et al., 2000; Bon - neuil & Fressoz, 2015; von et al., 2018; H ¨ofele et al., 2022a ). Even though the International Commission on Stratigraphy rejected the term “ Anthropocene ” on March 5, 2024 as a term for a new Earth epoch (in a not uncontroversial vote), the phenomenon of a lasting human influence on the entire biosphere of our planet is still a fact ( Zalasiewicz, Ade - neyThomas, Waters, Turner, & Head, 2024 ). This fact is becoming increasingly visible and obvious in the face of the notion “ Great Accel - eration ”, that captures exponential increase in many environmentally harmful parameters ( Steffen, Broadgate, Deutsch, Gaffney, & Ludwig, 2015 ). As a consequence, humanity is confronted with immense normative demands that cannot be ignored and which often cannot be tackled without technical innovations. In view of the ecological challenges of our present age, bioinspired technologies are increasingly important as future technologies ( Nachtigal et al., 1994; Benyus,, 2002; Nordmann, 2004; van et al., 2012 ). In this Special Issue, the term “ bioinspired technologies ” is un - derstood in two senses. In a narrower sense, it refers to technologies that imitate forms, structures or functional principles of nature, and that are developed within the research field of biomimetics. In a broader sense, this Special Issue also defines bioinspired technologies as those devel - oped with consideration for human or non-human nature and adapted to meet their respective needs.

{"page_content": "narrower or broader sense, are not simply solutions to current chal - lenges. They confront both scientists and society with sustainability is - sues and certain attitudes and preconceptions ( H ¨ofele, Reuter, Estadieu, Livanec, & Kiesel, 2022 ). The transfer of functions from biological models to technical applications does not guarantee that the applica - tions are good for humans and/or for the environment. Therefore, this transfer is not generally well-suited considering normative aspects. Biomimetic products such as facade paint with Lotus-Effect ®, bone-inspired ceiling structures or natural fibre constructions 1 are not per se better, more ecological and more trustworthy technical solutions. To determine whether the “ biomimetic promise ” of better, more ecological and more trustworthy technical solutions is kept, it is necessary to implement a second step of reflection, which considers the products independently of their pure imitation of biological functions ( Speck, Speck, Horn, Gantner, & Sedlbauer, 2017; M et al., 2021 ). The Special Issue “ Societal Implications of Bioinspired Technologies ” unites contributions from different disciplines, like engineering, biology, sustainability research, psychology, philosophy and ethics. It aims to discuss in what ways and to what extent bioinspired technologies pro - vide solutions to the societal challenges of the Anthropocene, and in how far the mentioned sciences can and even must contribute to future technical solutions. The challenges discussed under the term Anthro - pocene always require broad research alliances. These range from Earth System Science to biomimetics, a new approach to creating life-like technical materials systems, from sustainability research to human ecology, cultural ecology and ecocriticism, which seek to open a new space for societal reflection in the context of the current environmental crisis ( Ehlers & Krafft, 2006; H ¨ofele et al., 2022a; Müller, 2014; Steffen et al., 2016; Zapf, 2016 ). As diverse as these perspectives first appear, they all strive towards a new definition of the relationship between the natural and the artificial or between nature and technology in view of the current development and challenges. The current research approaches characterise the relationship of the individual disciplines to each other in a completely new way, while at the same time resulting in a new definition of society in view of its natural and technical environment ( Horn & Bergthaler, 2018; Inkpen et al., 2019; Schellnhuber, 2016 ). This can be demonstrated in an exemplary way within the Cluster of Excellence “ Living, Adaptive and Energy-autonomous Materials Systems ( liv MatS) ” at the University of Freiburg, Germany, in which all guest editors work and have come together. From the very beginning, this research consortium has been confronted with the challenge of reconsidering the coordinate system of nature, life and the living as well as technology and artificial materials with regard to society as they have become dubious in light of the cur - rent environmental crisis. This challenge will be met in the Special Issue in view of five questions that the following eleven articles in the Special Issue seek to answer. - How can the broad spectrum of bioinspired technologies be catego - rized and classified? - How and to what extent can bioinspired technologies contribute to a sustainable future and in particular to the development of sustain - able technologies? What criteria can be used to ensure their sustainability? - Which methods are suitable to measure or even ensure the societal acceptance of new bioinspired technologies? - How can sciences encourage the integration of bioinspired technol - ogies into society? - What ontological and ethical challenges do bioinspired technologies pose, insofar as they undermine the classical distinctions between nature and technology? The Special Issue seeks to contribute to answers to these five ques - tions and thus provides perspectives for future research on bioinspired technologies that are sustainable, ethically responsible, and socially acceptable. To this end, the Special Issue uses selected examples to provide an overview of the broad concept of bioinspired technologies as defined above. However, the main focus is on bioinspired technologies in the narrower sense, which imitate the forms, structures, properties and functions of living nature. 2. The contributions in detail The first article by Andr ´es Díaz Lantada et al. ( Díaz Lantada, Estadieu, Gorki, H ¨ofele, & Islam, 2024 ) seeks to explore the “ landscape ” of artificial materials and systems that mimic the properties of living things, in line with the narrower concept of bioinspired technology. In light of the multitude of quasi-living materials, structures, devices, and systems, it is initially crucial to differentiate and classify them effec - tively.

The contributions in detail The first article by Andr ´es Díaz Lantada et al. ( Díaz Lantada, Estadieu, Gorki, H ¨ofele, & Islam, 2024 ) seeks to explore the “ landscape ” of artificial materials and systems that mimic the properties of living things, in line with the narrower concept of bioinspired technology. In light of the multitude of quasi-living materials, structures, devices, and systems, it is initially crucial to differentiate and classify them effec - tively. This “ map ” offers an important basis for the exploration of the ethical, legal and social implications of bioinspired technologies. The following four articles take a closer look at the methodological background for the analysis and evaluation of bioinspired technologies. The article by Marco Tamborini ( Tamborini, 2024 ) examines the connection between bioinspiration and sustainability. The so-called “ biomimetic promise ” ( von Gleich, Pade, Petschow, & Pissarskoi, 2010 ) is not an automatism in the transfer of biological forms and functions to technical products. As Tamborini argues, this does not require an ontological analysis of nature, but rather a description of an “ epistemic grammar ” that plays a role in the transfer from nature to the field of technology. However, this transferred “ grammar ” only ensures sustainability in the field of technology if, in Wittgenstein ’ s words, the different “ language games ” and scientific practices are taken into ac - count. The interface between bioinspiration and sustainability is also examined in the article by Martin M ¨oller et al. ( M ¨oller, Speck, & Speck, 2024 ) that presents two methodological frameworks for prospective sustainability assessment: the Tiered Approach for Prospective Assess - ment of Benefits and Challenges (TAPAS) on the one hand and the Bioinspired Sustainability Assessment (BiSA) on the other hand. The sustainability strategies of efficiency, consistency, and sufficiency are provided as examples. The study by Asmaeil Ali Mohammed Akhmaaj and Mohamed Omar Sharif ( Akhmaaj et al., 2024 ) focuses on models of technology acceptance by future users. It integrates the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) ( Ajzen, 1991 ) with the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) ( Davis, 1989 ). As an example, the article analyzes the online shopping behavior of residents of the Libyan city of Tripoli, who were surveyed via Google. It looks at the relationship between social influence, perceived behavioral control, perceived usefulness, user-friendliness and purchasing behavior with regard to different age groups. The article thus has important implications for the development of bio - inspired technologies, as in addition to the sustainability of bioinspired forms and functions, the end users must always be taken into account to verify acceptance of technology development. This is precisely also the focus of the article by Wilhelm Johannes Gros et al. ( Gros et al., 2024 ). The method of Cognitive-Affective Mapping (CAM) presented in the article is a novel mind-mapping technique that enables laypersons to visually represent their belief structure and the associated affective assessment. It can also be used to evaluate the acceptance of new and therefore also bioinspired technologies ( H ¨ofele, et al., 2022 ), as the successful sustainability of technology relies on societal acceptance. The data obtained from the CAMs can be analyzed both quantitatively and qualitatively. The article demonstrates the reliability of this method using the example of Universal Basic Income, even though the method can be used much more broadly and especially with regard to bio - inspired technologies. The following article by Angela Zhou et al. ( Zhou et al., 2024 ) provides an example of assessing the acceptance of sustainable 1 Cf. https://www.livmats.uni-freiburg.de/en/news-press/robotisch-gewicke ltes-naturfasergebaude. P.

{"page_content": "technologies. Using the example of novel, colored photovoltaic systems, it is shown that sustainable technologies can generally be accepted by society. However, concrete acceptance depends on the specific context and the aesthetic embedding of sustainable technologies. For example, photovoltaic systems are generally accepted, but less so on old historic buildings. A similar approach is taken in the article by Mai Adel Mar - zouk et al. ( Marzouk, Salheen, & Fischer, 2024 ). They also look at the implementation of agricultural and solar energy systems in an urban context, albeit in a completely different cultural context, namely in the Cairo region. They take into account different variables such as age, gender, residence type as well as access to shared facilities and identify a knowledge gap regarding the agricultural and solar energy systems. Sustainable architecture is a key area in addressing the challenges of the 21st century. It faces not only increasing environmental challenges that demand carbon neutrality and resource efficiency, but also the challenges related to a growing global population and rising urbaniza - tion ( Ott et al., 2018 ). Bioinspiration is a promising method for building sustainable cities. This is shown in the article by Siddharth Chaudhary et al. ( Chaudhary et al., 2024 ). The authors focus on the intersection of biomimicry with sustainable construction technologies, passive cooling strategies, emulation of sustainable ecosystems, net-zero construction techniques, and innovative 3D-printed homes. The focus is on ethical-philosophical and psychological aspects to create a balance be - tween technological progress and a deep respect for nature. The article by Hamlet Vanderhorst et al. ( Vanderhorst, Heesom, & Yenneti, 2024 ) can be read as complementary to the previous articles on sustainable urban architecture. This is precisely the aim of the concept of the “ digital twin ”, which stands for a virtual manifestation of the construction process and the associated interactions and processes. It is also about the dimensions of the user ’ s experience. The article paints a picture of future municipalities venturing into the cyber world by embracing digital twins, smart cityscapes, blockchain technologies and other data sets to capture reality, thus arriving at an overarching vision of digital and physical construction domains. This goes hand in hand with a comprehensive consideration of the dimension of health. Here too, bioinspiration, or at least adaptation to the needs of human nature, plays a decisive role. Think, for example, of innovative health gadgets ranging from wearable fitness trackers to advanced robotic exoskeletons. The article by Yadong Chen et al. ( Chen, Li, Hussam, Baghaie, & Salahshour, 2024 ) looks at this in particular in the field of rehabilitation. The study uses machine learning to estimate recovery, performance and well-being by modifying reha - bilitation and health criteria. Finally, the closing article of the Special Issue by Rangga Kala Mahaswa et al. ( Mahaswa, Gebbyano, & Hardiyanti, 2024 ) is more of a prospective nature. It deals with the concept of the Anthropocene and reflects on the existing technological paradigms, in particular bio - inspired technologies, which arouse both promises and fears. The fact that the naturalization of technology and thus the technologization of nature disrupts our ontological understanding of the human-technology-world mediation is described as “ uncanny ”. Against this background, the article is concerned with a philosophical exami - nation of human existence in the Anthropocene in its relationship to the non-human world, in order to contribute to an ethically conscious and ecologically responsible technological practice.

Specifically, while limiting the scope to research in HRM, it aims to answer three questions that are relevant to the research community. The first question is whether research papers define the terms ’ bias ’ and ’ discrim- ination ’, and if so how. Second, given that there are different forms of bias and discrimination, the question is exactly which ones are being investigated. Are there any forms of bias and discrimination that are underrep- resented? The third question is whether a negativity bias exists in research on bias and discrimination in the context of AI. The answers to the first two questions point to some research problems. The review shows that in a substantial number of papers, the terms ’ bias ’ and ’ discrimination ’ are not or hardly defined. Furthermore, there is a disproportionate focus among researchers on bias and discrimination related to skin tone (racism) and gender (sexism). In the discussion, we provide reasons why this is undesirable for both scientific and extratheoretical reasons. The answer to the last question is negative. There is a relatively good balance between research that zooms in on the positive effects of AI on bias and discrimination, and research that deals with AI leading to (more) bias and discrimination. 1. Introduction It is a truism that AI has penetrated (almost) every domain of society within the short span of just over a decade, from education and research over banking and politics to sports and the legal system. In light of this, one might expect that research on AI has also increased, which then should result in more publications and participants at conferences on AI. This expectation is supported by data. In 2012 – the year Geoffrey Hinton presented the neural network-based face recognition system AlexNet, which boosted AI ’ s commercial breakthrough – about 196,000 articles on AI were published by scholars in both English and Chinese, ranging from journal articles to conference papers to books. Ten years later, that number had more than doubled. The number of people attending conferences on AI in recent years is in line with this. Despite the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of attendees would have roughly increased more than fivefold over the past decade ( Roser ). The same can be said of research on ethical topics related to AI. Research, both by philosophers and non-philosophers, is also increasing on the ethical questions about AI. At least that is one of the conclusions of the Stanford University Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2022, which annually provides an overview of trends in AI research: “ Research on fairness and transparency in AI has exploded since 2014, with a fivefold increase in related publications at ethics-related conferences. Algo- rithmic fairness and bias have shifted from being primarily an academic pursuit to becoming firmly embedded as a mainstream research topic with wide-ranging implications. Researchers with industry affiliations contributed 71% more publications year over year at ethics-focused conferences in recent years. ” ( Zhang et al., 2022 ) There is a wide variety of topics being written about by both phi- losophers and non-philosophers (including, for example, legal scholars and psychologists) in the papers in which they focus on ethics in the context of AI. These themes, among other things, include responsibility, job replacement, disinformation, privacy, bias, and discrimination. It is especially the last two topics that frequently reoccur in HRM ( Storm * Corresponding author. E-mail addresses: ikekez@student.foi.hr (I. Kekez), lode.lauwaert@kuleuven.be (L.

{"page_content": "Technology in Society 81 (2025) 102818 2 et al., 2023), (Triana et al., 2021). When one reads a paper that delves into ethics and AI, there is a real to very high probability that it will (also, and perhaps even primarily) discuss the risk that the output of a chatbot, for instance, reproduces sexist or racist stereotypes (bias), or that the paper will address the problem of an AI system treating people of color unequally based on their color (discrimination). In short, whether approached by scholars in philosophy or outside of the context of philosophy, when it comes to the ethics of AI, it often concerns bias and discrimination. The observation that both bias and discrimination are two prominent topics in the research of both philosophers and non-philosophers leads to (at least) three research questions. All of them probe the diversity in research, meaning they aim to determine whether certain concepts or themes are sufficiently present in studies on bias and discrimination in the context of AI. First, there is the question of whether scholars define bias and discrimination in their papers, and if so, what exact definitions they provide for both terms. The reason we bring this question to the fore is that many terms (including words with an ethical connotation) often do not have a clear-cut meaning, and thus, that they can express different concepts. Consequently, from a scientific point of view, it is undesirable when a paper does not define ‘bias’ or ‘discrimination’. After all, it can lead to it being unclear what exactly the study is and is not about, and it becomes difficult or even impossible to compare the results of different studies, i.e., it is than far from obvious to determine whether the studies replicate or contradict each other. Now, when a systematic review re- veals that there is a tendency not to define research terms, this may be a sign for the research community that there is a systematic research deficit that needs to be eliminated. On the other hand, when the terms are actually defined, it is relevant for researchers who focus on bias and discrimination in AI to learn in the review what exactly the definitions are. Indeed, in this way, one can get a picture of certain interpretations of bias and discrimination that are not or insufficiently represented, or scholars can then accurately determine, based on the review, whether new or forthcoming research does or does not align with existing research results. The second question concerns the characteristic on the basis of which bias or discrimination occurs. After all, both phenomena never arise in general but always stem from a specific characteristic of a particular individual or group. Moreover, there is a wide variety of characteristics on the basis of which someone can be biased or discriminated against. Skin tone and gender are perhaps the two best-known characteristics, but other characteristics such as age, mental or physical disabilities, religion, or physical attractiveness can also be the basis for bias or discrimination. The second research question, therefore, is the following: what forms of bias and discrimination are being studied in the context of AI? Here, too, the concern of unequal distribution plays a role. It is possible that certain forms of bias and discrimination are researched more or less frequently, which is undesirable from both a scientific and moral standpoint. If the systematic review indicates this, this would provide a reason for researchers to address the underrepresentation and overrepresentation. Third, do we face a negativity bias in research on bias and discrim- ination in the context of AI? More specifically, can one detect substan- tially more research on how AI can cause bias and discrimination (undesirable) than on how AI can be useful to address problems with bias and discrimination (desirable)? This question arises for several reasons. First, it is a well-documented scientific fact that humans have a negativity bias (among many other biases), meaning that they are more inclined to focus on bad news rather than good news (Rozin & Royzman, 2001), (Vaish et al., 2008). Additionally, scholars have previously sug- gested that there is indeed more attention given to the (ethical or not) drawbacks than the benefits of AI (Jecker & Nakazawa, 2022). Investi- gating whether this is actually the case is relevant. Indeed, if it turns out that there actually is more focus on the problems of AI in terms of bias and discrimination, then this can skew research priorities and outcomes, and may lead to an unbalanced understanding of AI’s capabilities and limitations. By consequence, the review could be a reason for re- searchers to fill this gap in the literature and to make sure that future provides a more balanced and constructive perspective on AI’s role in society. However, it is practically impossible to collect, screen, and analyze all papers on these three questions. It is thus essential to clearly define the domain and limit the number of", "metadata": {"producer": "Acrobat Distiller 8.1.0 (Windows)", "creator": "Elsevier", "creationdate": "2025-04-26T10:33:58+00:00", "crossmarkdomains[1]": "elsevier.com", "crossmarkmajorversiondate": "2010-04-23", "creationdate--text": "26th April 2025", "elsevierwebpdfspecifications": "7.0.1", "robots": "noindex", "moddate": "2025-04-26T10:39:15+00:00", "author": "Ivan Kekez", "doi": "10.1016/j.techsoc.2025.102818", "title": "Is artificial intelligence (AI) research biased and conceptually vague?

However, it is practically impossible to collect, screen, and analyze all papers on these three questions. It is thus essential to clearly define the domain and limit the number of papers. Therefore, we have chosen to exclusively focus on papers that discuss bias, discrimination, and AI in the context of Human Resources Management (HRM). There are at least three reasons why we decided to limit our review to HRM specifically. First, the expertise of two of the three authors lies within the research domain of HRM. Second, perhaps the most well-known case commonly used to discuss AI and ethics, particularly bias and discrimination, is precisely about HRM. We refer here to the case of Amazon exper- imenting with AI to screen job applications for new positions at the American company. This case became widely known because the AI system systematically excluded applications from female candidates, which is clearly a case of discrimination and can be described as ‘algo- sexism’ (Dastin). The third reason is that while AI solutions can enhance and improve human resource management (HRM) (Murugesan et al., 2023), there are also notable instances of bias and discrimination when AI is applied in this field. Given that HRM decisions directly impact individuals, this makes the issue particularly sensitive and important. The aim of this paper is to present a systematic review of the scien- tific literature that addresses these three research questions. RQ1. Do authors define bias and discrimination in research studies on AI adoption in HRM, and if so, how? RQ2. What are the main topics discussed in the research studies regarding bias and discrimination in HRM? RQ3. Do researchers focus more on desirable outcomes than on the undesirable effects of the use of AI? We proceed as follows. In the following section, we present the research methodology. After that, we provide the results of the study, which are discussed in the subsequent section. We close the paper with a final conclusion. 2. Research methodology In this section, we provide a systematic literature overview using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analysis, later in text PRISMA framework. The PRISMA framework was origi- nally published in 2009, later to be updated and replaced by the PRISMA 2020 and published in 2021 (Page et al., 2021). In contrast to conven- tional literature reviews, the PRISMA framework follows a strict pro- tocol designed using guidelines, checklist, explanation boxes and flow diagram. The PRISMA framework prioritizes defining exclusion and inclusion criteria to ascertain the suitability of literature for further analysis or to disprove its relevance (Xames & Topcu, 2024). The review involves four phases following the PRISMA guidelines: (i) identification, (ii) screening, (iii) eligibility, and (iv) inclusion. Each phase is explained in detail below and broad illustration is shown in Fig. 1. 2.1. Identification phase The identification phase focused on the selection of electronic sci- entific databases, as well as the retrieval of literature data need for analysis. The databases included were Web of Science Core Collection (CC), Scopus, IEEE Xplore Digital Library, Science Direct, and ProQuest. The search was performed iteratively through several testing phases in November and December 2023, while content analysis occurred in the first half of 2024.

With machine learning models increasingly uti- lized in predictive scenarios ( Barredo Arrieta et al., 2020 ), recent research on AI taxonomy highlights machine learning and deep learning models as the central domains of AI ( Graziani et al., 2023 ), ( Schwalbe & Finzel, 2023 ). In simple terms, machine learning is a field of AI that describes the system ’ s capacity to learn from data to automate and operationalize the process of analytical model building and task accomplishment. Deep learning is a sophisticated machine-learning concept based on artificial neural networks, prevalent in machine Fig. 1. PRISMA flow diagram, adopted by Page and colleagues ( Page et al., 2021 ).

Thus, considering the widespread use of machine learning and deep learning models in technical and social domains ( Graziani et al., 2023 ), we decided to form search queries around AI and its subsets: machine learning and deep learning. The broad representation of search queries used to identify literature was framed by the topic theme it represents: (i) „ artificial intelligen* “ OR „ machine learning “ OR „ deep learning “ AND (ii) „ discrimination “ OR „ bias “ AND (iii) „ human resource* “. The total number of records was 317 across five databases. Table 1 displays the database search queries alongside the number of records for each database per year. All records were extracted in either.csv or.txt format, depending on the export options provided by the respective databases. The selected categories for export included authors ’ names, article titles, document types, publication years, and abstracts. Additionally, a new category, „ database source, “ was added to the spreadsheet, using the following abbreviations for input: WoS (Web of Science), SCP (Scopus), SD (Sci- ence Direct), IEEE (IEEE Xplore Digital Library), and ProQ (ProQuest). Considering databases use different abbreviations or descriptions for document types, we have implemented a categorization system that ensures consistency across all exported records ( Table 2 ). Among the 317 records, 113 were identified as duplicates, leaving 204 records available for further analysis. The records were filtered using the inclusion/exclusion criteria shown in Table 3 below. We limited our analysis to records categorized as journal articles, conference papers, and review papers, as these publications often un- dergo a rigorous peer-review process. Journal articles typically receive more thorough review proces than conference papers. However, con- ference papers provide opportunities to present and discuss preliminary research results and are occasionally upgraded to meet journal article standards ( Gonz ´a et al., 2011 ). Records categorized as books, book chapters, working papers, dissertations, and other types were excluded from further analysis. The distribution of included records showed 107 journal articles, 42 conference papers, and 9 reviews. Records listed in languages other than English were excluded. Due to the relatively low number of included records, we decided to include records spanning the entire time range without setting restrictions based on the publication date. The total number of excluded records based on the given criteria was 46. 2.2. Screening phase The next stage of the PRISMA framework involved a review process for included records based on title and abstract review. The prior phase solely focused on filtering exported records using straightforward me- chanics such as database searches using queries, data export, minimal data pre-processing in Microsoft Excel, and defining and implementing inclusion and exclusion criteria. As we transition from ’ data-driven ’ information, solely based on extracted categories provided by databases, to content analysis of the extracted material, we will subsequently refer to the exported results as publications categorized as journal articles and conference papers. Given the importance of the screening phase, it is essential to establish a set of rules or questions that assist the screener in identifying eligible publications for further analysis ( Polanin et al., 2019 ). Additionally, because abstracts should provide a reader with the subject background, methods, results, and conclusion in a limited number of words, there is a possibility of misinterpretation due to insufficient information, poor quality, or deception using unjustified assumptions, leading readers to form a biased understanding of the paper ( Andrade, 2011 ). For that matter, we formed a short set of guidelines, reasoning the publication exclusion or inclusion for in-depth analysis ( Table 4 ). Furthermore, it is worth mentioning that during this phase, we focused on the research approach, themes discussed, and keywords rather than the results of the publications or the conclusions addressed in the abstract. At the end of the abstract screening process, 83 publications were recognized as relevant and set for download. In cases where the down- load link is not directly available in the database, the search is redirected to the publication source or the private profiles of the authors (e.g., ResearchGate).

Eligibility phase The eligibility phase marks the third stage in determining the pub- lication relevance for content analysis in the final phase. For abstracts that passed the screening phase and had accessible full versions for download, a comprehensive review is necessary. In this phase, any publications that deviate from the research goal or may been overlooked based on technical criteria are excluded from further analysis. By leveraging our research goal during the publication review, we have identified 24 publications that are not in alignment with our research objective or did not fulfill the required technical criteria. The majority of the excluded publications were irrelevant to the topic, with a few not meeting the minimal technical criteria. In addition, we expanded the number of publications by adding nine publications from additional sources. These publications were not identified using database search queries but were identified through a manual search on Google Scholar using predefined keywords. They were accessible for download and aligned with the research objective outlined in the introduction. Addi- tionally, all technical inclusion criteria for these publications were met. This approach aimed to partially mitigate the limitation of potentially overlooking relevant studies indexed in other sources. As a result, the final analysis included 64 publications. 2.4. Inclusion phase For the textual analysis, we chose to perform an inductive content analysis. Inductive content analysis involves analyzing chunks of textual data and setting coding rules to shrink the big-picture perspective into more manageable categories. That includes reading the full text and finding essential points related to the research questions ( Vears & Gil- lam, 2022 ). The unit of analysis was the whole publication included in the final phase. The coding template includes 9 categories that sum- marize information from the included publications. In short, this in- volves information on publication data (authors, title, year of publication), research focus, details on bias and discrimination (defini- tions, types and topics), and authors ’ perspectives on AI implications in practice. Finally, a structure and description of the coding template for content analysis are listed in Table 6. 3. Results This section discusses the results of the finally included publications in the content analysis. A total of 64 publications met the inclusion criteria and were included in the final analysis for the systematic liter- ature review. The analysis aims to identify thematic overlaps and as- sociations between parts of the included publications. The first part provides a descriptive analysis of publications included in the content analysis, followed by the second part, a numeric breakdown of the research questions mentioned in the previous section, represented through the subsections. Lastly, in the third part, we have summarized the research contributions, providing readers with a consolidated overview.

The earliest publication dates back to 2015, indexed in Scopus, followed by a conference paper listed in 2017 and indexed in Web of Science, Scopus, IEEE Explore Digital Library, and ProQuest, and another conference paper listed in 2018 and indexed in Scopus. The time span of the included publications ends with one journal article in early access, scheduled for publication in 2024. A graph containing information on identified and extracted pa- pers on December 8th, 2023., is shown below ( see Figs. 2 and 3 ). The distribution of the included publications ( Fig. 4 ), based on the database source, shows that the highest number of publications were indexed in Scopus alone (18), followed by publications indexed in Web of Science, Scopus, and ProQuest (11), as well as the intersection be- tween Web of Science and Scopus (11). All conference papers (17) were indexed in Scopus. The highest number of conference papers was indexed in Scopus alone (12), fol- lowed by the intersection of Web of Science, Scopus, IEEE Digital Li- brary, and ProQuest (3). Two conference papers were indexed in two separate groups: one combining Web of Science and Scopus and the other combining Scopus, IEEE Digital Library, and ProQuest. The highest number of journal articles were indexed as the intersection of Web of Science, Scopus, and ProQuest (11), followed by Web of Science and Scopus (10), and ’ Other ’ with Science Direct included (9). Only two groups had mixed distribution. Scopus alone had 18 publications indexed, predominantly conference papers (12). The intersection of Web of Science and Scopus had 11 publications indexed, mostly journal ar- ticles (10). The remaining nine groups were either fully journal article (7) or conference papers dominant (2). 3.2. Content analysis results of the initial set of publications In this section, we present the results of the content analysis. These results are segmented using a numeric breakdown for each research question, beginning with RQ1 and concluding with RQ3. Each research question represents one subsection of the content analysis, presenting the results and research contributions for each question individually. RQ1. Do authors define bias and discrimination in research studies on AI adoption in HRM, and if so, how? This research question aims to provide an overview of bias and discrimination definitions regarding studies on AI in HRM. Discrimina- tion can manifest in numerous forms, ranging from unequal treatment based on personal characteristics such as gender, age, and race ( Backhouse & Cherrier, 2019 ), ( Chen, 2023a ) to more contemporary discriminatory patterns such as sexual orientation, gender identity, or physical appearance of an individual ( Badgett et al., 2021 ), ( O ’ et al., 2013 ), ( Spiegel, 2023 ). On the other hand, the term ’ bias ’ is regularly used to convey technical meaning (e.g., algorithmic bias, AI bias, data bias, etc.), or it is a general term to form assumptions toward individuals or groups based on favoured preferences leading to the discriminatory actions ( Fiske, 1998 ), ( Penny ), ( Yam & Skorburg, 2021 ). Considering the diverse terminology surrounding bias and discrimination, the first step of this review is to highlight main terms discussed in the publica- tions. For that matter, Table 7 presents types of bias and discrimination along with their respective publication sources. Furthermore, defini- tions of bias and discrimination are shown later in Table 9. The most common types of discrimination were discrimination the- ory ( Chen, 2023a ), ( Tambe et al., 2019 ), ( Harris, 2020 ), ( Kim & Bodie, 2021 ), ( Hofeditz, Mirbabaie, et al., 2022 ), ( Heinrichs, 2022 ) and indi- rect discrimination ( Chen, 2023b ), ( Ramezanzadehmoghadam et al., 2021 ), ( Aloisi, 2024 ), ( Heinrichs, 2022 ), ( Gaudio, 2021 ), ( Mujtuba & Mahapatra, 2019 ), followed by disparate impact ( Charlwood & Gue- nole, 2022 ), ( Hamilton & Davison, 2022 ), ( Mujtuba & Mahapatra, 2019 ), direct discrimination ( Aloisi, 2024 ), ( Heinrichs, 2022 ), ( Gaudio, 2021 )", "metadata": {"producer": "Acrobat Distiller 8.1.0 (Windows)", "creator": "Elsevier", "creationdate": "2025-04-26T10:33:58+00:00", "crossmarkdomains[1]": "elsevier.com", "crossmarkmajorversiondate": "2010-04-23", "creationdate--text": "26th April 2025", "elsevierwebpdfspecifications": "7.0.1", "robots": "noindex", "moddate": "2025-04-26T10:39:15+00:00", "author": "Ivan Kekez", "doi": "10.1016/j.techsoc.2025.102818", "title": "Is artificial intelligence (AI) research biased and conceptually vague?

{"page_content": "Technology in Society 81 (2025) 102818 8 ( Heinrichs, 2022 ), direct discrimination ( Heinrichs, 2022 ) and past discrimination ( Moore and Duffy, 2019 ). These studies discussed mentioned terms in the broad context of their respective analyses. Other terms also included algorithmic discrimination ( Vassilopoulou et al., 2024 ), ( Aloisi, 2024 ), disparate treatment ( Kim & Bodie, 2021 ), ( Mujtuba & Mahapatra, 2019 ), gender discrimination (Gonz ´a et al., 2024), ( Hofeditz, Mirbabaie, et al., 2022 ), proxy discrimination ( Hofeditz, Mirbabaie, et al., 2022 ), ( Fern ´andez-Martí et al., 2020 ), explicit and implicit discrimination ( Frissen et al., 2023 ), individual, institutional, and organizational discrimination ( Heinrichs, 2022 ), etc. Hofeditz and colleagues ( Hofeditz, Clausen, et al., 2022 ) introduce the concept of discrimination based on \"sensitive attributes,\" which uniquely combines age, gender, and race under a single term. However, the term is viewed separately from gender discrimination (Gonz ´a et al., 2024), ( Hofeditz, Mirbabaie, et al., 2022 ), racial discrimination ( Williams, 2020 ), and age discrimination ( Hofeditz, Mirbabaie, et al., 2022 ) discussed in separated studies. Among the studies on discrimi- nation, a significant proportion (25.6%) addresses a single discrimina- tion term, suggesting a wide range of perspectives within the field. Notably, the concepts of discrimination theory and indirect discrimi- nation each received the highest attention in 15.4% of studies. The most prominent terms considering bias refer to the unconscious bias ( Yam & Skorburg, 2021 ), ( Salvetti et al., 2023 ), ( Chen, 2023b ), ( Shanmugam & Garg, 2015 ), ( Sadler Smith et al., 2022 ), ( Veglianti et al., 2023 ), (Gonz ´a et al., 2024), ( Budhwar et al., 2023 ), ( Gikopoulos, 2019 ), ( Hemalatha et al., 2021 ), ( Paigude et al., 2023 ), algorithmic bias ( Soleimani, Intezari, & Pauleen, 2021 ), ( Chen, 2023a ), ( Cho et al., 2023 ), ( Feldkamp et al., 2024 ), ( Oravec, 2022 ), ( Parra et al., 2022 ), ( Rodgers et al., 2023 ), ( Tambe et al., 2019 ), ( Varsha, 2023 ), ( Vassilopoulou et al., 2024 ), cognitive bias ( Soleimani, Intezari, & Pauleen, 2021 ), ( Cho et al., 2023 ), ( Varsha, 2023 ), ( Vassilopoulou et al., 2024 ), ( Harris, 2020 ), ( Sadler Smith et al., 2022 ), ( Soleimani, Intezari, Taskin, & Pauleen, 2021 ), ( Veglianti et al., 2023 ), human bias ( Varsha, 2023 ), ( Al-Alawi et al., 2021 ), ( Gusain et al., 2023 ), ( Kim & Bodie, 2021 ), ( Moore and Duffy, 2019 ), ( Trocin et al., 2021 ), and gender bias ( Parra et al., 2022 ), ( Varsha, 2023 ), (Gonz ´a et al., 2024), (Fern ´andez Martí et al., 2019), ( Harris, 2018 ), ( Kappen & Naber, 2021 ).

Relevant to this research, the term „ artificial intelligence “ (AI) bias is introduced but constitutes a smaller portion of studies ( Varsha, 2023 ), ( Jacob Fernandes França et al., 2023 ). Among the studies on bias, a substantial percentage (28.0%) mention a single term related to bias, indicating a broad spectrum of perspectives within the discourse on bias, mirroring the diversity observed in results on discrimination. Besides bias and discrimination, the some studies also extensively discuss fairness, which is closely related to discrimination. In short, fairness is often viewed as the inverse of discrimination ( Harris, 2020 ) and revolves around preventing discriminatory actions toward in- dividuals or groups ( Future of Privacy Forum, 2018 ) in a given social setting or situation ( Getnet et al., 2014 ). The prominent term concerning the fairness theme is \"fairness and unfairness\" combined ( Harris, 2020 ), ( Ramezanzadehmoghadam et al., 2021 ), ( Kim & Bodie, 2021 ), ( Hofeditz, Mirbabaie, et al., 2022 ), ( Delecraz et al., 2022 ), ( Mujtuba & Mahapatra, 2019 ). Additional terms also includes algorithmic fairness ( Danner et al., 2023 ), counterfactual fairness ( Mujtuba & Mahapatra, 2019 ), distributive fairness ( Robert et al., 2020 ), objective and subjec- tive fairness ( Hofeditz, Mirbabaie, et al., 2022 ), favoritism ( Chilunjika et al., 2022 ), ( Kshetri, 2021 ), justice ( Hamilton & Davison, 2022 ), and more. Given the study ’ s focus on bias and discrimination, we have excluded further analysis of these terms in the following sections. A list of publications ( Achchab et al., 2022 ), ( Arafan et al., 2022 ), ( Barati & Ansari, 2022 ), ( Bartosiak & Modlinski, 2022 ), ( Escalante et al., 2017 ), ( Jadav et al., 2022 ), ( Sakka et al., 2022 ), ( Todolí-Signes, 2019 ), ( Vrontis et al., 2022 ), ( Zhang & Amos, 2024 ) remained ’ unsorted ’ due to its wider perspective of the terms. Overall, out of the 164 terms analyzed, 93 (56.7%) are related to bias, 39 (23.8%) are related to discrimination, and the remaining 32 terms (19.5%) pertain to concepts such as fairness, justice, favoritism, and similar topics. Focusing exclusively on bias and discrimination, 70.5% of the identified terms address some form of bias, while 29.5% pertain to discrimination. The general representation featuring the main terms regarding bias and discrimination, along with the corresponding number of studies in which identified terms appear, is presented in Table 8 below. The breakdown of terms has provided a foundation for addressing the primary goal of the first research question: to determine how many studies define bias, discrimination, or both within their respective contexts and how authors define both terms.

While the terms bias and discrimination alone are insufficient to answer this research question, it nonetheless represents a necessary step toward reviewing definitions of bias and discrimination. To provide a clear answer to this research question, a Table 9 combines terms, definitions or explanations, and both primary and secondary sources for each definition. Among the 58 terms related to bias and discrimination, 35 are defined or explained in enough detail (60.3%). Of the 64 studies analyzed, 30 (46.9%) included definitions or explanations for atleast one of the terms. The remaining 34 studies (53.1%) lacked clear defi- nitions or explanations of the terms used in research. Within the discrimination theme, authors provided definitions and explanations for twelve discrimination terms, including discrimination theory ( Chen, 2023a ), ( Tambe et al., 2019 ), ( Harris, 2020 ), ( Kim & Bodie, 2021 ), ( Hofeditz, Mirbabaie, et al., 2022 ), ( Heinrichs, 2022 ) and indirect discrimination ( Ramezanzadehmoghadam et al., 2021 ), ( Aloisi, 2024 ), ( Mujtaba & Mahapatra, 2019 ), ( Gaudio, 2021 ), which were among the most frequently discussed.

{"page_content": "Technology in Society 81 (2025) 102818 11 2024 ), ( Oravec, 2022 ), ( Varsha, 2023 ) provided most definitions of the term, followed by a social bias ( Kimura, 2023 ), ( Feldkamp et al., 2024 ), ( Ramezanzadehmoghadam et al., 2021 ), and cognitive bias ( Soleimani, Intezari, & Pauleen, 2021 ), ( Harris, 2020 ), ( Soleimani, Intezari, Taskin, & Pauleen, 2021 ). In the context of this study, it is worth mentioning that authors also provided definitions for algorithmic discrimination ( Aloisi, 2024 ), AI bias ( Varsha, 2023 ), ( Jacob Fernandes França et al., 2023 ), and data bias ( Robert et al., 2020 ), which are closely related to the undesirable and unintended discriminatory actions often performed by machines against humans. AI bias, also called ’ machine learning bias ’ or ’ algorithmic bias ’, combines various sources of bias within the context of AI. That may include bias from algorithm predictions, training data, or cognitive biases resulting from human decision-making ( IBM ). Consequently, AI bias is a product of diverse factors that extend across both systemic and human aspects; therefore, we have decided to categorize AI bias as an individual class of bias. RQ2. What are the main topics discussed in the research studies regarding bias and discrimination in HRM? This subsection presents the findings concerning bias and discrimi- nation topics. These topics are categorized across 12 groups, each rep- resenting a set of ’ traits ’ based on which bias may occur, leading to unequal treatment toward individuals or groups. Two additional groups have been added for studies that approached bias and discrimination discussion more broadly and for those that didn ’ t discuss topics in detail. For instance, bias or discrimination based on gender considers discriminatory action or preference toward an individual or group of people based on their gender identity (male, female, or other). In this context, gender is a topic within the bias and discrimination theme, and gender identity is a construct that reflects an individual ’ s social perception or biological trait based on their sex ( Blackstone et al., 2003 ). Table 10 summarizes publications based on main topics regarding bias and discrimination. The most frequently discussed topic regarding bias and discrimina- tion is gender (45.3%), followed by race (32.8%) and age (17.2%). Additionally, a significant share of publications (34.4%) address bias and discrimination from a general perspective. Although a few studies from the general discussion could potentially overlap with other publi- cations listed under different topics, we have chosen to list them in the general discussion category because they provide a broader perspective on bias and discrimination and its occurrence in HRM. Furthermore, 8 publications (12.5%) do not delve into specific topics in detail; instead, they generally focus on other aspects of AI ’ s potential to enhance HRM while taking care of potential discriminatory biases. Moreover, we categorized all publications according to their primary theme regarding bias and discrimination and sorted them by the topics they discuss in the publication. The following categorization distinguishes three variations: ’ B ’ for publications focused on bias, ’ D ’ for publications focused on discrimination, and ’ BD ’ for publications with a balanced focus on bias and discrimination. Table 11, featuring topics and the corresponding number of studies regarding publication theme, is shown below. Following the thematic categorization of publications, the highest number of topics is found in publications with a balanced focus on bias and discrimination (56.5%), followed by bias (36.9%) and discrimination (6.9%). Within each theme, gender is the most promi- nently discussed topic ( Fig. 5 ), comprising 24.3% of mentions in pub- lications discussing bias and discrimination and 13.7% in total, 18.8% in publications discussing bias and 6.9% in total, and 22.2% in publications focusing solely on discrimination with only 1.5% in total. Within pub- lications with a balanced focus on both bias and discrimination, it is noteworthy that 21.6% of topics are racial-based (12.2% in total), while 14.9% fall under general discussion (8.4% in total). General discussion also emerges as a dominant topic in both bias-focused publications with 18.8% and those focusing on discrimination 22.2%, but with only 1.5% in total. The least discussed topics across all themes are culture (B = 4.2%, D = 0%, BD = 0%), religion/faith (B = 2.1%, D =", "metadata": {"producer": "Acrobat Distiller 8.1.0 (Windows)", "creator": "Elsevier", "creationdate": "2025-04-26T10:33:58+00:00", "crossmarkdomains[1]": "elsevier.com", "crossmarkmajorversiondate": "2010-04-23", "creationdate--text": "26th April 2025", "elsevierwebpdfspecifications": "7.0.1", "robots": "noindex", "moddate": "2025-04-26T10:39:15+00:00", "author": "Ivan Kekez", "doi": "10.1016/j.techsoc.2025.102818", "title": "Is artificial intelligence (AI) research biased and conceptually vague?

RQ3. Do researchers focus more on desirable outcomes than on the unde- sirable effects of the use of AI? In this review, we identified the main terms regarding bias and discrimination. Among the 58 identified terms, 35 were defined in enough detail across 30 of the 64 studies analyzed. Furthermore, related to bias and discrimination terms, we identified twelve topics repre- senting a set of traits that might lead to discriminatory actions, including ’ others ’ that combine various, less popular topics. The findings present an essential element for further analysis as we conducted a set of con- ditions regarding the implications of AI solutions to solve discriminatory bias in HRM: (i) the study addresses bias and discrimination terms, (ii) the study provides definitions for the mentioned terms; (iii) the study discusses the positive or negative implications of AI in the context of HRM. Conditions (i) and (ii) are addressed in the first and second research questions, leaving the third condition open for analysis and discussion. In particular, numerous studies explore the implications of AI on HRM processes, including automation in recruitment and selection, performance evaluation and prediction, talent acquisition, and overall workplace processes. Although our work refers to studies in an HRM context, the goal of this paper is not to examine operational HRM pro- cesses. This analysis is part of another paper complementary to this research, which will be published in the near future. Instead, we aim to investigate how AI may impact potential biases and discriminatory outcomes toward people within HRM. Upon reviewing the publications on the positive and negative im- plications of AI adoption, we found that out of the 64 publications analyzed, 14 leaned toward positive implications (21.9%), 23 toward negative implications (35.9%), and 13 had a balanced focus on both positive and negative implications (20.3%). For the additional 14 pub- lications (21.9%), we could not determine their main focus in discussing AI implications, as the focus was more on operational processes rather than people in HRM. Various authors have discussed the documented history of discrim- inatory outcomes associated with AI solutions ( Jacob Fernandes França et al., 2023 ), ( Budhwar et al., 2023 ), ( Moore and Duffy, 2019 ), ( Mujtuba & Mahapatra, 2019 ), ( Barati & Ansari, 2022 ). Some have even high- lighted the absence of clear guidelines within organizations on how to use AI to mitigate bias and address discrimination (Gonz ´a et al., 2024). Furthermore, some authors have pointed out the mistaken belief that AI Table 9 ( continued ) Term Definition/Explanation Source cited Main source „ Sensitive attributes “ discrimination Discrimination based on „ characteristics of candidates who are of older age, foreign race, or female and consider these attributes in the context of an AI-based system for candidate management. “ – Hofeditz, Clausen, et al.

{"page_content": "Technology in Society 81 (2025) 102818 13 algorithms are inherently objective and fair, which can contribute to discriminatory outcomes ( Vassilopoulou et al., 2024 ), ( Kim & Bodie, 2021 ). Although algorithms may ’ de-humanize ’ bias provided by human judgment ( Rodgers et al., 2023 ), it is indeed vulnerable to bias itself, especially if trained on inaccurate and unrepresentative data, leading to the self-reinforced biased decisions ( Soleimani, Intezari, Taskin, & Pauleen, 2021 ). Because biased preferences can be encoded into AI so- lutions, decision-making may result in discriminatory outcomes toward individuals or groups of people ( Yam & Skorburg, 2021 ). On the other hand, research on the positive implications of AI highlights that bias is not intrinsic to the technology itself but rather influenced by human factors and the quality of the data provided. Studies suggest that well-designed AI systems have the capacity to mitigate unconscious bias, as they inherently operate with a higher degree of objectivity compared to human decision-makers ( Gusain et al., 2023 ), ( Gikopoulos, 2019 ). That implies that machines are not discriminatory, but rather humans who either work with biased data and unintentionally produce discriminatory outcomes or are a source of discrimination by not promoting diversity (Gonz ´a et al., 2024), which overflows on organizational culture and practices. Moreover, gaining knowledge about AI can lead to less bias and discrimination ( Hofeditz, Clausen, et al., 2022 ), as AI solutions are able to provide objective decision-making, reducing the reliance on subjective heuristics ( Sadler Smith et al., 2022 ) and removing irrelevant information that might affect decision-making ( Tambe et al., 2019 ). By leveraging these capa- bilities, organizations can promote fair outcomes in domains where AI is applied. Lastly, Table 12 combines all sources that met a set of conditions concerning the implications of AI. These conditions include discussing the terms bias and discrimination, providing definitions within their publications, and presenting both positive and negative implications of AI adoption. The highest number of publications meeting all three conditions are categorized under negative implications (n = 11), followed by those sorted under positive implications (n = 9), and publications with balanced implications (n = 8). The most frequently defined and dis- cussed terms include ’ discrimination theory ’ (n = 6) and ’ algorithmic bias ’ (n = 6). ’ Discrimination theory ’ appears across positive (n = 1), negative (n = 3), and balanced (n = 2) implication breakdowns, while ’ algorithmic bias ’ is predominantly found under negative implications (n = 4), followed by balanced implications (n = 2). Additionally, AI bias falls under the category of negative and balanced implications (n = 2), alongside algorithmic bias and data bias (n = 1), forming a group of negative algorithmic implications arising from inaccurate and unrep- resentative (biased) data running on AI solutions. 3.3. Research contributions The first subsection (RQ1) examines the definitions of bias and discrimination in the context of using AI in HRM. From 164 identified terms, 93 (56.7%) were related to bias, 39 (23.8%) to discrimination, and 32 (19.5%) were associated with other terms such as fairness, jus- tice, favoritism, and more. Given the study ’ s direction described in the introduction, we have excluded further analysis of terms other than bias and discrimination. Frequency comparison between bias and discrimi- nation revealed that 70.5% of terms are related to some form of bias, in contrast to discrimination ’ s 29.5%. This breakdown provided a foun- dation for addressing the primary goal of the first research question: to determine how many studies defined or explained bias and discrimi- nation and how authors define both terms. Of the 58 individually identified terms of bias and discrimination, 35 (60.3%) were defined (or explained) in enough detail. Among 64 studies analyzed, 30 (46.9%) included definitions of terms, whereas 34 (53.1%) lacked explicit defi- nitions of the terms used in research. The most frequently defined terms were discrimination theory, indirect discrimination, and algorithmic bias.

{"page_content": "Technology in Society 81 (2025) 102818 14 The second subsection (RQ2) presents findings on bias and discrimination types categorized into 12 topics, each representing a set of traits leading to unfavorable treatment of individuals or groups. Gender was the most discussed topic (45.3%), followed by race (32.8%) and age (17.2%). More than a third of publications (34.4%) addressed bias and discrimination from a general perspective. 12.5% of publica- tions did not delve into specific topics but discussed AI ’ s potential to enhance HRM while taking care of discriminatory bias. Following the thematic categorization of publications, most combined bias and discrimination (56.5%), with fewer publications addressing bias alone (36.6%) or discrimination alone (6.9%). Within each theme, gender featured in the highest number, comprising 24.3% of mentions in bias and discrimination discussions (13.7% overall) and 18.8% in bias- oriented publications (6.9% overall), followed by race and age. Cul- ture, religion/faith, origin, and socioeconomic status were the least addressed topics. Finally, in order to explore AI ’ s implications in addressing discrim- ination and mitigating bias (RQ3), the first step was to set preliminary conditions for all publications: (i) The publication addresses bias and discrimination terms; (ii) the study provides definitions for the mentioned terms; (iii) the study discusses the positive or negative im- plications of AI in mitigating bias and tackling discrimination. The first two conditions (i-ii) were part of RQ1 and RQ2, leaving the third for analysis. Among 64 publications, 14 leaned toward positive implications (21.9%), 23 were negative (35.9%), and 13 had a balanced focus on both positive and negative (20.3%). The remaining 14 studies (21.9%) lacked clear focus. For those studies meeting all criteria (i-iii), negative impli- cations were most common (n = 11), followed by positive (n = 9) and balanced (n = 8). The most discussed terms were discrimination theory (n = 6) and algorithmic bias (n = 6), with discrimination theory spanning positive, negative, and balanced views, while algorithmic bias mainly appeared in negative contexts. 4. Discussion In this section, we highlight three topics that emerge from the research findings and that (may) warrant further discussion or research. The first relates to conceptual unclarity (and follows from the first part research), the second to conceptual diversity (and is also based upon the first part of the research), and the third to underrepresentation of types of bias and discrimination (which follows from the results of the second part of the research). Regarding the third research question, we believe that there is a good balance between research focusing on positive and negative effects, so this does not need further discussion. 4.1. Conceptual unclarity of bias and discrimination The first point is based upon the finding that a substantial proportion of papers on bias and discrimination in the context of AI do not define (or define poorly) either term. Specifically, the systematic review found that in more than half of the papers, more precisely in 53.1%, there is no clear definition of bias and discrimination. We find this a very striking and undesirable finding, which should preferably be addressed by scholars - they could, for example, develop some standardised lexicon, or scholars could at least be more ecplicit about the concepts they use. The finding is all the more undesirable since, as indicated in the intro- duction, we see no reason why this review cannot be representative of other domains. In short, this result compels us to the problematic conclusion that research on bias and discriminaition in the cotnext of AI overall (and thus not only with regard to HRM) faces a major conceptual problem. There are at least two reasons why the observed conceptual unclarity is problematic. First, the lack of conceptual clarity is not conducive to scientific inquiry. If a study does not provide a clear and precise description of bias and discrimination, it becomes (nearly) impossible, or at the very least highly challenging, to replicate the research accu- rately. The lack of clarity also hinders the integration of the findings with existing studies, which is crucial for advancing the field. Addi- tionally, without well-defined terms, it becomes difficult to critically evaluate the research, as key concepts may be interpreted differently. This is particularly problematic because the processes of replication, integration, and critical evaluation are fundamental pillars of rigorous scientific research. The second reason why the lack of clear descriptions is undesirable is that it complicates, or even makes problematic, policies around bias and discrimination.

However, if studies indi- cate that the use of AI leads to (or can lead to) bias and discrimination, and if those studies are conceptually unclear about what bias and discrimination actually mean, it becomes difficult, if not impossible, to develop an effective policy solution. Indeed, how can one develop a solution, if the exact nature of the problem is unclear? Another possi- bility is that policymakers push through certain measures anyway, only to find out later that they are ineffective. This could be because they mistakenly relied on a vague definition, resulting in policies that address a different issue and thus fail to achieve their intended goal. In the best- case scenario, such policies are merely ineffective, but there is also the risk that this could lead to decreased trust in AI, financial costs, or even that the ineffective policy inadvertently causes significant collateral damage. 4.2. Conceptual diversity of bias and discrimination The second point for further discussion stems from the observation that there is significant conceptual diversity, meaning that the survey reveals that the terms ‘bias ’ and ‘discrimination ’ are used to refer to a wide range of concepts, which sometimes have little to no relation to each other. For instance, when we focus on ‘bias ’, it becomes clear that the term can refer to the fact that the data used to train an AI system is not representative (as seen in ‘data bias ’ ), while ‘bias ’ can also refer to the unequal treatment of individuals (as is the case with ‘gender bias ’ ). In the first case, bias is situated at the input level, specifically during the training phase, whereas in the second case, bias is situated at the output level. Although the second type of bias is usually a consequence of bias in the dataset (and not the other way around), they nonetheless pertain to different aspects. A related difference is that, in the first case, bias is a characteristic of the dataset with which the system is trained, while in the second case, bias is attributed to the system itself, particularly the output produced by that system – such as text, images, recommenda- tions, decisions, etc. When we delve further into bias at the output level, additional distinctions can be detected. The systematic review shows that for some researchers, bias refers to a non-neutral treatment of data or information, while other scholars use ‘bias ’ to refer to non-neutral treatment of individuals or groups. Furthermore, it appears that some researchers understand bias as a morally neutral concept, whereas in other instances, ‘bias ’ expresses a normative concept. For example, ‘human bias ’ is understood as ‘unfair disadvantage ’, while ‘implicit racial bias ’ refers merely to assumptions about racial identity. The latter is purely descriptive and does not carry any evaluative judgment about holding those assumptions. As shown in the second part of the research, this also applies to discrimination. In this case, too, it turns out that the term is defined in numerous different ways. This is relevant information that adds value to the findings of the first part of the research. There, it was revealed that a significant portion of studies either do not define or insufficiently define ‘bias ’ and ‘discrimination ’, leading to the problem that comparing studies becomes very difficult, if not impossible. Now, if it turns out that studies that do provide clear definitions for both terms still do not overlap in their definitions, then these studies cannot be compared, and thus cannot be used to replicate or critique each other. This inability no longer stems from a lack of definition (as in the first part of the research) but from the observation that different studies each address something (entirely) different, even though they all deal with bias and discrimi- nation in the context of AI. For example, when two studies suggest that AI is associated with gender bias, one cannot conclude from that alone that the studies support each other. In one case, the gender bias might be related to the fact that the dataset used to train the technology is not representative, while in the other case, the gender bias might refer to the observation that the chatbot ’ s texts more frequently mention men than women. 4.3. Underrepresentation of bias and discrimination types The third topic concerns the distribution of types of bias and discrimination in research on AI. The results from the second research question clearly show that this distribution is uneven, namely, the vast majority of studies on bias and discrimination in the context of AI focus on gender or race/color. More precisely, 78.1% of the studies address these two forms. This means that less than a quarter of scientific studies focus on other forms of bias and discrimination.

{"page_content": "Technology in Society 81 (2025) 102818 16 point of view, research on bias and discrimination could itself be considered as biased. Although we believe that neutrality in scientific research is not necessarily undesirable and is (sometimes) even impossible, it is at least a reason for concern that certain forms of bias and discrimination are so strongly represented. Indeed, it is possible that other forms of bias and discrimination have not been as thoroughly investigated. Of course, we know that an unequal number of studies does not necessarily imply that these lesser-studied forms are less well-examined than the forms with more research. The reason is that different studies often confirm the same findings, which means that the phenomenon in all its diversity is not necessarily studied more deeply than phenomena with fewer studies. Nonetheless, it remains possible that this is the case. This is a possibility that should be further explored, because if it indeed turns out that the smaller number of studies also means that these other forms of bias and discrimination are less well-understood, then there is reason to consider that undesirable. When it becomes evident that the focus is primarily on race and gender, and consequently (much) less on other forms of bias and discrimination, such as those related to age and disabilities, the scientific knowledge of these other forms is limited. This results in an incomplete understanding of how AI systems produce undesirable effects in various contexts. From a purely scientific standpoint, this is not ideal, but this realization also has extratheoretical consequences. If bias or discrimi- nation by AI is indeed a problem, then it is clearly an issue that needs to be addressed (or for which a solution should be sought). Such an approach benefits from a thorough understanding of the problem to be solved. However, if the knowledge is limited, the solution may also be inadequate. In short, there is a risk that strategies for addressing certain forms of bias and discrimination may not be sufficiently effective, due to an insufficient scientific foundation. If there is indeed a lack of under- standing (which, as mentioned, should be further investigated), then this is a reason for the research community to shift focus and better distribute resources. This would not only increase the likelihood of effective solutions, but also eliminate the undesirable (and perhaps unintended) suggestion that certain forms of bias and discrimination are more important than others, that it is more important to thoroughly investigate racism and sexism than, for example, ableism, lookism, or ageism. 5. Conclusion In this study, we analyzed the literature on bias and discrimination in the context of using AI in the HRM environment. The systematic review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta- Analysis (PRISMA) framework. The main goal of this systematic review paper was to investigate relevant research on bias and discrimination in the context of using AI in the HRM environment. More specifically, we aimed to answer three questions to increase awareness of the impor- tance of bias and discrimination controversies in using AI. We found a lack of precise portrayal in a considerable share of papers on bias and discrimination terms. We also concluded that there ’ s sig- nificant conceptual diversity within topics, making research on bias and discrimination even more challenging and complex. However, it adds to the allure and intrigue of the field, opening up numerous opportunities for future research. When it comes to the distribution of studies focusing on the positive and negative implications of AI, they are reasonably balanced, reflecting researchers ’ neutrality regarding whether the implementation of AI in HRM could lead to desirable or undesirable effects on bias and discrimination. Besides the earlier mentioned restriction regarding a narrowed area of research (HRM), this study has few limitations in its research approach. First, we did not use reliability or consistency measures ( Cook & Beckman, 2006 ) to validate paper selection during the screening or eligibility phases, which could potentially lead to biased decisions regarding whether a paper was deemed eligible. Instead, considering the number of identified papers (after duplicate removal and filtering) was somewhat low, we followed a set of predefined criteria for each phase individually to aid the paper selection process and ensure consistency. Second, database (de)selection could also lead to missing other relevant studies indexed in different electronic databases. Our decision to focus on five selected databases (Web of Science, Scopus, ScienceDirect, ProQuest, and IEEE Xplore) was largely subjective and driven by the open access provided by the university. Third, qualitative text-based content analysis often contains a degree of uncertainty in determining bias and discrimination themes and topics. By addressing the limitations of this study and building upon the discoveries presented, we believe this research topic holds significant potential for generating new knowledge and closing research gaps in this emerging field. Future research could extend our work by focusing on the types of AI addressed in studies related to bias and discrimination concerns, or by focusing more specifically on the HRM domain, where discriminatory bias is evident in areas such as hiring, promotion, training, wages,", "metadata": {"producer": "Acrobat Distiller 8.1.0 (Windows)", "creator": "Elsevier", "creationdate": "2025-04-26T10:33:58+00:00", "crossmarkdomains[1]": "elsevier.com", "crossmarkmajorversiondate": "2010-04-23", "creationdate--text": "26th April 2025", "elsevierwebpdfspecifications": "7.0.1", "robots": "noindex", "moddate": "2025-04-26T10:39:15+00:00", "author": "Ivan Kekez", "doi": "10.1016/j.techsoc.2025.102818", "title": "Is artificial intelligence (AI) research biased and conceptually vague?

Given the variety of AI systems available and discussed in papers, the question may be which type of AI the research addresses in the studies on bias and discrimination concerns. Some AI systems, like facial recognition or automated decision-making, may have a more deep impact on individuals and society than other tech- nologies, including the HRM domain. Furthermore, others, ranging from AI for facial recognition to chatbots to AI that evaluates job applications, are at greater risk of being biased or discriminatory than other AI ap- plications. Alternatively, this could involve exploring various areas within HRM, such as recruitment, selection, performance management, monitoring, or compensation strategies, to identify and address poten- tial biases. Leading through these issues may create valuable research opportunities in the long term.

However, uptake is uneven across European countries. The impact of factors influencing the adoption of electric vehicles has been highlighted in recent literature. Nevertheless, this literature has scarcely considered willingness to pay, the risks associated with the purchase, and the moderating variables in consumers ’ purchase intention. This research addresses this gap and aims to analyze these factors. To this end, these variables are incorporated into a model based on the theory of planned behavior (TPB) and the norm activation model (NAM). The model estimation was developed through the data collected from a questionnaire given to regular drivers in Spain (n = 1241) and analyzed using partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM). The results indicate that awareness of environmental issues and consequences of one ’ s actions, along with social pressure, activate the individual personal norm, channeling these effects towards intention, and with greater intensity towards willingness to pay. In addition, the influence of performance and financial risks was confirmed, albeit with a lower impact than expected on purchase intention. The analysis also reveals significant moderating ef - fects, with variations observed based on age, income, primary vehicle use, and prior experience with electric or hybrid vehicles. 1. Introduction The use of traditional fuels in transport significantly contributes to greenhouse gas emissions ( Andersson & B ¨orjesson, 2021; da Silva et al., 2022; Huo et al., 2012 ). As such, the transport sector occupies a critical position in the fight against climate change and efforts to protect the environment ( Cifuentes-Faura, 2022; Vajjarapu et al., 2019 ). Road mobility, in particular, has a notable impact on environmental degra - dation and the depletion of natural resources ( Cifuentes-Faura, 2022 ). Furthermore, combustion engines in road traffic negatively affect air quality and increase noise pollution in urban areas ( Jacyna et al., 2017; Nieuwenhuijsen, 2021 ). One way to tackle these problems is through the application of alternative propulsion technologies, such as those used in electric and hybrid vehicles ( Adu-Gyamfi, Song, Obuobi, et al., 2022; Kandidayeni et al., 2022; Lu et al., 2020; Onat & Kucukvar, 2022 ). These technologies have the potential to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels and lower pollutant emissions. Pure electric vehicles are considered zero-emission vehicles (ZEVs). According to Rosales-Tristancho et al. (2022), they are one of the most solid options for overcoming the problems associated with conventional mobility. Electric vehicles offer several advantages over conventional vehicles that make them attractive to consumers: they produce no polluting emissions, handle well, are easy to drive, and have low noise pollution levels ( Rosales-Tristancho et al., 2021 ). However, despite the similar - ities in product categories between electric and traditional vehicles, market penetration rates for electric vehicles vary significantly. In some countries, the electric vehicle registration rate lies around just 1% (Cyprus, Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia), while in others it exceeds 80% (Norway) ( Agency, 2022 ). This disparity is likely due to barriers that hinder mass adoption, such as higher purchase prices, lack of charging infrastructure, limited range, or long charging times ( Rosales-Tristancho et al., 2022 ). Additionally, psychological factors, such as values, perceptions, and attitudes towards the product and the environment, may also play a role ( Li et al., 2017; Vafaei-Zadeh et al., * Corresponding author.

{"page_content": "2022; Wang et al., 2016 ). In relation to this, it seems that the countries with the highest electric vehicle adoption rates ( IEA, 2022 ) tend to be those with higher household disposable income ( OECD, 2022 ) and more deeply-rooted environmental values and ecological culture ( Halman et al., 2022; Rodríguez, 2021 ). The ongoing debate about the transition to electric vehicles has sparked significant interest among academics and professionals in identifying effective strategies to accelerate environmental efficiency while meeting consumer mobility needs ( Nayum & Th ø gersen, 2022 ). Recent evidence indicates that consumers ’ purchasing decisions are influenced by both moral environmental awareness (altruistic behavior) and the cost-benefit and social repercussions of their decisions (rational behavior) ( Adu-Gyamfi, Song, Obuobi, et al., 2022; Asadi et al., 2021; B ¨osehans et al., 2023; Gunawan et al., 2022; Hasan, 2021; Huang et al., 2021; Li et al., 2017 ). From the perspective of environmental psychol - ogy, several theories have capitalized on research on purchase intention ( Asadi et al., 2021; Singh et al., 2020; Vafaei-Zadeh et al., 2022 ). Two of the most prominent are the theory of planned behavior (TPB) ( Hasan, 2021; Li et al., 2020; Shalender & Sharma, 2021; Wang et al., 2016 ), and the norm activation model (NAM) ( Ashraf Javid et al., 2021; He & Zhan, 2018; Nordlund et al., 2018 ). The TPB focuses on rational decision-making by potential adopters ( Ajzen, 1991; Egbue & Long, 2012; Secinaro, Calandra, Lanzalonga, & Ferraris, 2022 ), whereas the NAM includes less rational components, such as conscience and moral norms ( Schwartz, 1977; Schwartz & Howard, 1981, pp. 189 – 211). While the literature on factors influencing electric vehicle adoption is extensive, recent systematic reviews in sustainable mobility reveal knowledge gaps that require further empirical research ( Adnan et al., 2017; Coffman et al., 2017; Das et al., 2020; Kandidayeni et al., 2022; Kumar & Alok, 2020; Li et al., 2017, 2019; Onat & Kucukvar, 2022; Qazi et al., 2019; Singh et al., 2020 ). Firstly, most studies on purchase behavior use intention as the sole dependent variable ( Bjerkan et al., 2016; Hamzah & Tanwir, 2021 ). This approach provides partial infor - mation since it is not known if the intention ultimately translates into greater willingness to assume the purchase costs. Secondly, the studies that have merged the TPB and the NAM, as reviewed by Hamzah and Tanwir (2021), reveal the need to extend the integrated framework to include a greater number of triggers of electric vehicle adoption, in order to increase its explanatory power. That is, it should incorporate de - mographic characteristics (e.g. personal and family), situational aspects (e.g. technical characteristics), psychological attributes (e.g. experience, social influence and values) ( Li et al., 2017; Tunçel, 2022 ), as well as the risks associated with the purchase ( Kumar & Alok, 2020 ). Lastly, almost all the studies that integrated the TPB and the NAM were conducted in developing ( Asadi et al., 2021; Hamzah & Tanwir, 2021 ) or established non-European economies ( Dong et al., 2020 ); consequently, there is a need for new evidence that allows cross-cultural comparisons of the results obtained. The present study seeks to fill the gap described above by investi - gating the underexplored areas of willingness to pay and the integration of additional triggers (risks associated with the purchase) in the TPB and NAM frameworks. This includes the examination of moderating vari - ables, such as demographic and situational factors. By so doing, it can provide researchers, professionals from the automotive sector and public policymakers with useful information about the aspects that determine the choice of electric vehicles ( Kumar & Alok, 2020; Singh et al., 2020 ).

By so doing, it can provide researchers, professionals from the automotive sector and public policymakers with useful information about the aspects that determine the choice of electric vehicles ( Kumar & Alok, 2020; Singh et al., 2020 ). In particular, it can shed light on the complex psycholog - ical process underlying the intention to buying and willingness to pay for an environmentally friendly product that is more expensive than the product it replaces ( IEA, 2022 ). On this basis, three questions guide our analysis: Is the intention to purchase an electric vehicle connected to willingness to pay? What impact do financial and performance risks have on purchase intention and willingness to pay? Do consumers ’ de - mographic and situational variables moderate the relationships of the psychological constructs of the NAM and the TPB with purchase inten - tion and willingness to pay? In order to answer these questions, we propose a extended framework based on a combination of the TPB ( Ajzen, 1991 ) and the NAM ( Schwartz, 1977; Schwartz & Howard, 1981, pp. 189 – 211). Accordingly, the objective of this study is to develop a psychosocial model of electric vehicle adoption to identify the predictors of drivers ’ purchase intention and willingness to pay. The resulting hypotheses are tested on a sample of 1241 regular Spanish drivers. Spain may be an especially useful case to study as it is a European economy with average household disposable income ( OECD, 2022 ), an electric vehicle adoption rate lower than the average of its surrounding coun - tries ( ANFAC, 2022 ), and with a sales share of new electric cars that barely reaches 8% ( IEA, 2022 ). In general, the contribution of this study to the literature is twofold: firstly, although intention can be a good indicator of electric vehicle purchase behaviour, the effects of personal norm and intention on the willingness to pay more for an environmentally friendly product should not be overlooked ( Bhutto et al., 2021; Ferguson et al., 2018; Hidrue et al., 2011 ). On the other hand, we offer a novel perspective by extending the integration of the TPB and the NAM to consider how financial and performance risks might lessen intention and willingness to pay ( Kumar & Alok, 2020 ). Furthermore, previous analyses based on the TPB and the NAM do not delve into the possible moderating effects of situational variables relating to the consumer ( Asadi et al., 2021; Dong et al., 2020; Hamzah & Tanwir, 2021 ): age, gender, family income, possibility of installing a charging point, main use of the vehicle, prox - imity to charging points, and previous driving experience ( Li et al., 2017; Tunçel, 2022 ). 2. Literature review and hypothesis development 2.1. Background In 2018, transport activities were responsible for about 29% of total CO 2 emissions in the European Union ( European Parliament, 2020 ). Growing institutional concern has led to ambitious new legislative proposals: “ To raise the contribution of the road transport sector to the EU ’ s climate targets, the proposal sets more ambitious 2030 targets for reducing the CO 2 emissions of new cars and vans and allows only zero-emission ve - hicles from 2035 ” ( European Parliament, 2022 ). The rise in regulation on the CO 2 emissions generated by the transport sector has stimulated the growth of the European electric vehicle market during the period 2016 – 2021 ( IEA, 2022 ). In 2021, even with the mobility restrictions stemming from the Covid-19 pandemic, electric cars accounted for 17% of total car sales in Europe, and in the last quarter of the year they exceeded diesel car registrations for the first time. However, the distri - bution of new electric car sales is uneven across countries, with Norway (86%), Iceland (72%), Sweden (43%), the Netherlands (30%), and Germany (26%) leading the market, followed at some distance by France (19%), Italy (9%), and Spain (8%) ( IEA, 2022 ).

The rise in regulation on the CO 2 emissions generated by the transport sector has stimulated the growth of the European electric vehicle market during the period 2016 – 2021 ( IEA, 2022 ). In 2021, even with the mobility restrictions stemming from the Covid-19 pandemic, electric cars accounted for 17% of total car sales in Europe, and in the last quarter of the year they exceeded diesel car registrations for the first time.

Germany, a country that offers some of the highest subsidies in Europe to support the transition to electric vehicles, is the largest market in terms of total number of electric vehicles in circulation (IEA, 2022). Despite this growth, it is still expensive to buy an electric car in Europe. In fact, over the course of 2021, the average price of battery electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids rose by 3% and 4% compared to 2020, to an average of 50,000 and 57, 000 dollars, respectively — well above the average for a diesel or gasoline vehicle. With this upward trend set to continue for the next few years due to the conflict in Ukraine and problems with the supply of raw materials ( IEA, 2022 ), some European countries will find it difficult to meet the proposed goals for more sustainable mobility in 2035 ( European Parliament, 2022 ). In these circumstances, organizations such as the Spanish Associa - tion of Automobile and Truck Manufacturers (ANFAC) recently warned that the distance between Spain and other countries in terms of elec - tromobility continues to increase ( ANFAC, 2022 ). Indeed, although sales of electric and hybrid vehicles are rising, they represent barely 3.5% of the total vehicles in circulation in Spain. In addition, for every new L.J. Cabeza-Ramírez et al.

{"page_content": "passenger car that is registered, almost two are sold that are over 10 years old. What is more, one in four of these second-hand units is over 20 years old, which implies that some cars kept in circulation do not incorporate the necessary technological advances in safety, sustain - ability and emission reduction ( ANFAC, 2022 ). On the other hand, this organization also points out that new economic subsidies are urgently needed to tackle the renewal of the stock of cars on the road and awareness-raising measures, as well as to increase the deployment of charging infrastructure, which is at a level four times lower than that demanded by the market ( ANFAC, 2022 ). 2.2. Theory of planned behaviour (TPB) The theoretical framework of the TPB proposed by Ajzen (1991) emerged with the aim of perfecting the predictive power of the theory of reasoned action ( Fishbein & Ajzen, 1977; Kumar & Nayak, 2022 ). Both approaches were designed to understand the behaviour arising under volitional control ( Hankins et al., 2000 ). The basic premise of the psy - chosocial model of the TPB is that attitudes, subjective norms and perceived control are the fundamental determinants of a person ’ s in - tentions to perform a specific behaviour ( Ajzen, 1991; Kumar & Nayak, 2022 ). Kumar and Nayak (2022), in their recent meta-analysis of the behaviours linked to the use of green energy, presented the original definitions of the three basic constructs of the model as follows: attitude, “ the individual ’ s positive or negative evaluation of performing the behavior ”; subjective norm, “ the person ’ s perception of social pressure put on him to perform or not perform the behaviour in question ”; and perceived behav - ioural control, “ the person ’ s belief as to how easy or difficult performance of the behaviour is likely to be ” (p. 149). According to the TPB, intention is the immediate antecedent of effective behaviour ( Ajzen, 1991 ). Under this premise, it is postulated that if the intention is strong enough, the chances of performing a certain behaviour increase substantially ( Kumar & Nayak, 2022 ). Additionally, Ajzen (1991) recommended extending his model to adapt it to different behaviours, taking into account a series of conditions for new inclusions ( Cabeza-Ramírez, S ´anchez-Ca ˜nizares, et al., 2022a, b; Meng & Choi, 2016 ): “ they must be imperative factors that affect the decision-making process, they must be conceptually independent of the original, and they must be potentially appropriate for gaining an under - standing of a specific behaviour ”. The extended model of the TPB has been used repeatedly in research on electric vehicle adoption, demonstrating its effectiveness in advancing the understanding of the determining factors of adoption ( Moon, 2021; Singh et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2016 ). For example, in the context of China, where electric vehicles are much more economical ( IEA, 2022 ), Li et al. (2020) applied an extension of the TPB including the personal norm as an additional variable, along with direct and moderating effects of a set of variables related to electric vehicle adoption policies (consistency, coherence, credibility, comprehensive - ness). According to their results, attitude was the predictor that made the most powerful contribution to intention, followed by the personal norm. Meanwhile, Shalender and Sharma (2021), focusing on India, a country where buying an electric car entails a substantial effort ( IEA, 2022 ), added the influence of the moral norm and environmental concern; however, the impact of these variables was found to be less than expected, well below that of the other, original TPB variables. In other studies, by contrast, researchers opted to integrate the TPB with some other theoretical framework, such as the technology acceptance model (TAM) ( Adu-Gyamfi, Song, Obuobi, et al., 2022; Huang et al., 2021; Th ø gersen & Ebsen, 2019; Tu & Yang, 2019; Vafaei-Zadeh et al., 2022 ); diffusion of innovation (DOI) theory ( B ¨osehans et al., 2023; Moon, 2021; Tu & Yang, 2019 ); the norm activation model (NAM) ( Asadi et al., 2021; Dong et al., 2020; Hamzah & Tanwir, 2021 ), or the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology ( Gunawan et al., 2022 ).

These studies confirmed that the three main variables of the TPB had a significant influence on intention. 2.3. The norm activation model (NAM) The theoretical model NAM was developed to explain intention and behaviour in altruistic pro-social contexts ( Schwartz, 1977 ): \"altruistic behaviour is causally influenced by feelings of moral obligation to act on one ’ s personally held norms ”. It is framework based on people ’ s interest in acting in favour of other people and society. A specific example would be the case of pro-environmental behaviour ( Bobeth & Kastner, 2020; De Groot & Steg, 2009 ). The basic premise is that people feel morally obliged to act in a manner that is beneficial to the environment in line with their internal feelings, referred to as their personal norm (PN). This norm guides their decisions such that they perceive their behaviour to be morally acceptable ( Bobeth & Kastner, 2020 ). Unlike the TPB, there are different interpretations of the NAM in the framework of environmental psychology ( Kl ¨ockner, 2013a ). This is because its formal structure was not fully developed ( Kl ¨ockner, 2013a, 2013b; Schwartz & Howard, 1981, pp. 189 – 211). In its original conception, there were three antecedents of altruistic behaviour: a) awareness of consequences (AC), that is, a personal understanding of the results of individual actions for the collective well-being; b) ascription of responsibility (AR), the individual assignment of obligation for the ac - tions performed; and c) personal norm (PN), a reflection of the indi - vidual value system in a given situation ( Kl ¨ockner, 2013a; Schwartz & Howard, 1981, pp. 189 – 211). The model can be approached in terms of either mediation or moderation ( De Groot & Steg, 2009; Kim et al., 2018 ). In the first form, it is configured sequentially; that is, the awareness of the consequences influences the ascription of re - sponsibility, which in turn determines the personal norm, and finally leads to intention. In the second approach, the personal norm de - termines intention, although this relationship is moderated by the ascription of responsibility and the awareness of the consequences ( Gunawan et al., 2022; Sovacool, 2014 ). Both rationales are plausible. However, comparative studies yielded clearer results with the mediator model ( De Groot & Steg, 2009; Kim et al., 2018; Onwezen et al., 2013 ). As with the TPB, the NAM can be extended by including new vari - ables or being combined with other theories ( Kl ¨ockner, 2013a, 2013b ). In the field of research on the acceptance of electric mobility, the extended or integrated framework has demonstrated its versatility for shedding light on the determinants of electric car purchases ( Asadi et al., 2021; Dong et al., 2020; Hamzah & Tanwir, 2021; He & Zhan, 2018; Nordlund et al., 2018 ). Focusing on China, He and Zhan (2018), pro - posed a model adding in the external costs (perceived price and perceived complexity), as well as perceived consumer effectiveness, showing that this last variable has a particular influence on the personal norm. For the same country, Dong et al. (2020) integrated the TPB and the NAM along with other cost factors (purchase price, daily energy consumption costs, and maintenance costs). They showed how, in the presence of subsidies, costs did not significantly influence intention, while the personal norm was found to be the fourth most important predictor (after attitudes, subjective norm", "metadata": {"producer": "Acrobat Distiller 8.1.0 (Windows)", "creator": "Elsevier", "creationdate": "2025-04-26T11:38:27+00:00", "crossmarkdomains[1]": "elsevier.com", "crossmarkmajorversiondate": "2010-04-23", "creationdate--text": "26th April 2025", "elsevierwebpdfspecifications": "7.0.1", "robots": "noindex", "moddate": "2025-04-26T11:44:19+00:00", "author": "L.

As additional variables incorporated into the resulting model, the first study examined perceived value and effectiveness, and incentive policies, while the second examined environmental knowledge as a moderating variable. The two studies found significant links between the personal norm and the intention of adoption. In the European context (Sweden), Nordlund et al. (2018) investigated whether the perception of justice and the effectiveness of electric vehicle stimulus measures were related to the norm activation process in three groups of car owners, revealing that individuals with prior experience owning an electric vehicle exhibited greater environmental awareness, higher self-efficacy, and a stronger personal norm.

{"page_content": "2.4. The integration of the TPB and the NAM The review conducted by Adnan et al. (2017) highlighted the importance of incorporating environmental moral obligations in the TPB-based studies applied to the adoption of electric vehicles. In response to this call, recent studies have justified the combination of the TPB and the NAM as a way of including both the consumer ’ s rational factors and altruism in decision-making about electric vehicle adoption ( Asadi et al., 2021; Hamzah & Tanwir, 2021 ). This captures the dual nature of the electric vehicle, instrumental and pro-environmental ( Onat & Kucukvar, 2022; Rosales-Tristancho et al., 2022 ). Moreover, the integration of the two theories allows a more complete explanation of electric vehicle purchasing behaviour ( Adnan et al., 2017 ). This argu - ment is supported by the research of Huijts et al. (2013) and Ong and Musa (2011), who pointed out that the TPB would only be able to explain rational pro-environmental decisions based on social influence and a cost-benefit calculation. However, when both frameworks are combined, the resulting model includes the rational aspects and the pro-social incentives arising from the consumer ’ s moral obligation ( He & Zhan, 2018 ). Nevertheless, the firm consensus on the benefits of integrating the TPB and the NAM ( Asadi et al., 2021; Dong et al., 2020; Hamzah & Tanwir, 2021 ) fades away when it comes to addressing the proposed relationships between the variables and the structure of the resulting model. Hamzah and Tanwir (2021), in their study of the intention to purchase hybrid vehicles, reviewed a set of studies demonstrating this. In this regard, Kl ¨ockner (2013a), in his meta-analysis involving a comprehensive model of the psychology of environmental behaviour, explained that if the personal norm is activated in a person — that is, when the personal value system is aligned with the fight against envi - ronmental deterioration — it would have an effect on intention (I). In this case, the NAM variables are positioned as antecedents of the variables included in the TPB ( Asadi et al., 2021; Dong et al., 2020; Hamzah & Tanwir, 2021 ), with purchase intention (I) positioned a dependent variable in the combined model. Kl ¨ockner (2013a) identified four acti - vators of the personal norm (PN): 1) awareness of the existence of a need or problem; 2) awareness of the repercussions of performing the behaviour; 3) acceptance of responsibility for one ’ s actions; and 4) a perceived ability to perform the actions in question. In the previous literature, the activators, as well as the terms used to describe them, have varied according to the interpretation of the NAM ( Hamzah & Tanwir, 2021; Kl ¨ockner, 2013a; Schwartz & Howard, 1981, pp. 189 – 211). In this paper, we follow the adaptation used by Hunecke et al. (2001) and applied by Bobeth and Kastner (2020) to make adjustments to the NAM. In the context of this study, potential buyers of an electric vehicle will have their personal norm activated when they accept their re - sponsibility and become aware of an environmental problem (Problem Awareness, PA), in turn becoming aware of the beneficial consequences for the environment of purchasing an electric vehicle (Awareness of Consequences, AC). These two variables, as defined by Bobeth and Kastner (2020), include the first three activators proposed by Kl ¨ockner (2013a), while the fourth is equivalent to the perceived behavioural control (PBC) of the TPB. In addition, Bobeth and Kastner (2020) pro - pose a new activator, the social norm (SN), defined as the influence that society and opinion leaders have on the personal norm (PN). This ac - counts for the social impact as an important part of electric vehicle adoption. This activator was included as relevant element in the seminal paper on the NAM by Schwartz and Howard (1981, pp. 189 – 211). In turn, the social norm (SN) has two components: the descriptive social norm (DSN), that is, what people perceive is appropriate to do in society, based on what is happening around them; and the injunctive social norm (ISN), referring to the behavioural expectations generated by their closest personal referents (friends, partner, family, colleagues) ( Bobeth & Kastner,", "metadata": {"producer": "Acrobat Distiller 8.1.0 (Windows)", "creator": "Elsevier", "creationdate": "2025-04-26T11:38:27+00:00", "crossmarkdomains[1]": "elsevier.com", "crossmarkmajorversiondate": "2010-04-23", "creationdate--text": "26th April 2025", "elsevierwebpdfspecifications": "7.0.1", "robots": "noindex", "moddate": "2025-04-26T11:44:19+00:00", "author": "L.

In the TPB, the two components are usually incor - porated together in the subjective norm with no distinction made between them, although they can be considered separately ( Ajzen, 1991; Cialdini et al., 1990; Minton et al., 2018 ). Based on the above, we propose the first hypotheses of the model. H1. Awareness of the environmental consequences (AC) of buying an electric vehicle positively influences personal norms (PN). H2. The awareness of the environmental problem (PA) positively in - fluences the personal norm (PN). H3. The descriptive social norm (DSN) positively influences the per - sonal norm (PN). H4. The injunctive social norm (ISN) positively influences the per - sonal norm (PN). H5. The personal norm (PN) positively influences the intention to purchase an electric vehicle (I). H6. Perceived behavioural control (PBC) positively influences the intention to purchase an electric vehicle (I). When breaking down the social norm into descriptive and injunc - tive elements ( Ajzen, 1991; Cialdini et al., 1990; Minton et al., 2018 ), we assume that the injunctive social norm forms part of the subjective norm of the standard TPB model ( Ajzen, 1991 ). As explained by White et al. (2009), instead of considering norms as a unitary construct, it is more appropriate to differentiate them into descriptive and injunctive norms. Descriptive norms reflect perceptions of what others do, while injunctive norms reflect perceptions of what others approve of or think one should do. In this sense, the subjective norm component of the TPB can be better understood as an injunctive social norm, as it deals with the perceived social pressures from significant others to perform a spe - cific behavior. It is therefore necessary to address the direct connections between the descriptive and injunctive social norm (as well as the relation to purchase intention). Bobeth and Kastner (2020) point out that the descriptive social norm plays an informative role, while the injunctive social norm exerts the social pressure from the close personal referents. Different studies support the direct effects between the com - ponents of descriptive and injunctive social norms ( Kl ¨ockner, 2014; Sang & Bekhet, 2015 ), and the meta-analysis of Kl ¨ockner (2013a) lends empirical support to the two roles of the social norm ( Bobeth & Kastner, 2020 ). Based on the above, we propose the following hypotheses. H7. The descriptive social norm (DSN) positively influences the injunctive social norm (ISN). H8. The injunctive social norm (ISN) positively influences the inten - tion to purchase an electric vehicle. Although previous empirical evidence has confirmed the relation - ships proposed above that form the basis of the combined TPB and NAM ( Asadi et al., 2021; Dong et al., 2020; Hamzah & Tanwir, 2021 ), one of the latest meta-analyses on the application of the TPB to predict green energy behaviour indicates that attitude (A) is the most crucial ante - cedent of intention (I) ( Kumar & Nayak, 2022 ). In this sense, both the awareness of the environmental problem (PA) and the awareness of consequences (AC) should have some kind of direct positive effect on the TPB construct attitude (A) ( Bobeth & Kastner, 2020; Kl ¨ockner, 2013a ).

Awareness of the environmental consequences (AC) of buying an electric vehicle positively influences attitudes towards electric vehicles (A). H11. Attitudes towards electric vehicles (A) exert a positive influence on intention (I). 2.5. Willingness to pay for electric vehicle adoption Research on the introduction of health and environmental protection measures has defined willingness to pay as the monetary value a user would be prepared to pay for a positive change ( Ramdas & Mohamed, 2014; S ´anchez-Ca ˜nizares et al., 2021 ). It is an indicator used to measure the cost that would be assumed for enjoying an improvement or will - ingness to accept in the quality of a good. In addition, it is used as an instrument to assess behaviours aimed at beneficial transitions ( Ramdas & Mohamed, 2014 ). Therefore, willingness to pay is considered an appropriate tool for evaluating resources that do not have a specific market value, such as the environment ( Ramdas & Mohamed, 2014; S ´anchez-Ca ˜nizares et al., 2021 ). Thus, the environmental improvement achieved by reducing polluting emissions from combustion vehicles would be a clear example of a global public good; in other words, despite the fact that countries and individuals face individual costs in reducing emissions, the advantages of such endeavors are distributed amongst all, regardless of their individual contributions ( Hasson et al., 2010 ). The recent study by Ssebbugga-Kimeze (2022) applies game theory ( von Neumann & Morgenstern, 1944 ) and the prisoner ’ s dilemma to put the focus on the quandary facing the user: to buy a more expensive vehicle and cooperate in advancing the global good, or to wait and buy a standard car. This author recalls the existence of \" free riders ”, in this case, those unwilling to compensate for the negative externalities derived from their consumption ( Ramdas & Mohamed, 2014 ). He also references the tragedy of the commons ( Hardin, 1968 ) to refer to those who will not take action because of the cost, out of self-interest, out of fear that their investment will be exploited by others, or out of hopelessness and feelings that their contribution will make no difference ( Ssebbugga-Kimeze, 2022 ). The author also focuses on possible adjust - ments: incentivizing aid to taxpayers, coercion through laws and taxes, and encouraging behavioural changes through learning and awareness-raising ( Ssebbugga-Kimeze, 2022 ). Nevertheless, the effects of the first two may not be long-lasting and may depend on national policy. For example, in the case of Spain, there are purchase incentives for electric vehicles (Plan MOVES III) of up to 7000 euros ( MTERD, 2021 ), but they cannot reach the entire population. Moreover, even with the subsidy, an electric car is still more expensive than a conventional one. On the other hand, coercive measures to adapt to European regu - lations ( European Parliament, 2020 ), such as the regulation introducing low-emission zones, have only been partially effective in dissuading people from buying combustion vehicles, and such zones are being implemented gradually ( ANFAC, 2022; IEA, 2022 ). In contrast, the third way is linked to the strength of the public ’ s environmental awareness and their personal norm ( Asadi et al., 2021; Dong et al., 2020; Hamzah & Tanwir, 2021 ). In any case, the adopter must be willing to pay a higher amount to cooperate with the fight against climate change ( ANFAC, 2022; IEA, 2022 ). The relationship between the strength of the personal norm (PN) and the predictive power of the altruistic model of Schwartz (1977) was evidenced by Guagnano et al. (1994): “ The Schwartz model explains stated WTP for environmental quality, except when payments are framed as taxes\". Based on this, we propose. H12. The personal norm (PN) positively influences willingness to pay for the purchase of an electric vehicle (WTP). At the same time, there is a good deal of evidence on the use of the willingness to pay variable to quantify the monetary value that potential adopters would find acceptable for the purchase of an electric vehicle ( Ardeshiri & Rashidi, 2020; Hidrue et al., 2011; Parsons et al., 2014 ). By comparison, there are very few studies that consider willingness to pay as a direct antecedent of behaviour ( Shi et al., 2023; Zheng et al., 2022 ).

It seems probable that a person who is willing to pay more for an electric vehicle would be more likely to perform the behaviour. From this perspective, Shi et al. (2023) indicate that, unlike intention, willingness to pay specifically determines the economic sacrifice; therefore, in the absence of information about the actual behaviour, it can be taken as a second predictor to be analyzed. This reasoning has previously been applied in the context of Covid-19 safety measures ( S ´anchez-Ca ˜nizares et al., 2021 ), ecotourism ( Hultman et al., 2015 ), and electric vehicles ( Shi et al., 2023 ). Therefore, we propose. H13. The intention to purchase an electric vehicle (I) positively in - fluences the willingness to pay for an electric vehicle (WTP) 2.6. Risks associated with electric vehicle adoption Since Bauer (1960) formally proposed “ that consumer behaviour be viewed as risk taking ” ( Taylor, 1974 ), the role of risk has been extensively examined in studies on the purchase of different products and services ( Cabeza-Ramírez, S ´anchez-Ca ˜nizares, et al., 2022a, b; Luo et al., 2010; Siegrist & ´ Arvai, 2020; Weegels & Kanis, 2000 ), including electric ve - hicles ( Featherman et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2018 ). Likewise, the vari - able has been applied to understand the way in which consumers evaluate recommendations to buy a product ( Cabeza-Ramírez, S ´anchez-Ca ˜nizares, et al., 2022a, b ). As pointed out by Wang et al. (2018), risk is a multifaceted psychological construction defined as \"the expected negative utility that consumers associate with the purchase of a particular product or service ” ( Dunn et al., 1986 ). Consequently, perceived risk involves consumers considering in advance a possible loss related to the purchase and grading the level of uncertainty that they feel when weighing up their purchase, as well as incorporating beliefs about possible unfulfilled expectations ( Cabeza-Ramírez, S ´anchez-Ca ˜nizares, et al., 2022a, b; Kim et al., 2008 ). Most of the related studies that have considered risk have identified several types: financial, performance, physical, psychological, social, time, and opportunity cost risk ( Jacoby & Kaplan, 1972; Kim et al., 2008 ). For example, Featherman et al. (2021) presented a complete conceptualization of the seven dimensions applied specifically to electric vehicles. Barriers to electric vehicle adoption have also been observed. Rosales-Tristancho et al. (2022) compiled and categorized previous studies on this subject, highlighting barriers such as a lack of infrastructure, limited range, higher purchase price, and others related to the performance and characteristics of the batteries.

In this regard, the study by Wang et al. (2018) showed how perceived risk negatively affected attitudes to electric vehicle adoption and purchase intention. Similarly, Featherman et al.

{"page_content": "intention, while risks reduced purchase intention. The three aforemen - tioned studies were conducted in different contexts: China, the United States and India, respectively, and a notable influence of risk perception was found in all of them. More recently, the same relationship was found in smaller population segments (Generation Y in Malaysia) ( Vafaei-Zadeh et al., 2022 ). Based on this, we propose the hypotheses. H14a. b Perceived financial (PFR) and performance (PPR) risks negatively influence the attitude towards electric vehicles (A). H15a. b Perceived financial (PFR) and performance risks (PPR) negatively influence the intention to purchase an electric vehicle (I). Finally, as far as we know, the direct relationship between perceived risk and willingness to pay remains practically unexplored in the field of electric vehicles. This is not the case in the field of health, where Hunter et al. (2012) stated that \" Work has shown that an individual ’ s WTP for health-risk reductions is also dependent on their perception of- and attitude towards those risks ”. More recently, Liu et al. (2019), in their research on self-driving vehicles, confirmed that perceived risks had a negative in - fluence on willingness to pay. More specifically, they found that people who were familiar with this class of vehicles reported greater confi - dence, higher willingness to pay, and perceived greater benefits and lower risks. Accordingly, we propose. H16a. b Perceived financial (PFR) and performance (PPR) risks negatively influence the willingness to pay for the purchase of an electric vehicle (WTP). 2.7. Proposed extended model: effects of demographic and situational variables Previous research on electric vehicles has been divided into two main streams ( Secinaro et al., 2022 ). The first centres on recognizing and developing the debate about electric vehicles, highlighting issues that support their adoption, while the second focuses on exploring the bar - riers perceived by consumers when weighing up the purchase of an electric vehicle. These two major lines of research converge when addressing the antecedents to the purchase decision. In this respect, in addition to the factors discussed above, it has been shown that the in - fluence of demographic factors (personal and family characteristics) and situational factors (proximity to charging points, previous experience, etc.) could moderate the proposed relationships ( Kumar & Alok, 2020; Li et al., 2017; Tunçel, 2022 ). Based on this, the model is completed with the inclusion of seven control variables: age, gender, income level, possibility of installing a charging point, proximity to a charging point, main use of the vehicle (short/long trips), and previous experience with electric or hybrid vehicles. Fig. 1 shows the extended integrated NAM-TPB model we propose in this study. 3. Research method The analysis method used was structural equation modeling. Ac - cording to Duncan (1966), this method allows for the modeling of po - tential causal effects based on the specification of variables and the relationships identified by established theories ( Cabeza-Ramírez, S ´anchez-Ca ˜nizares, et al., 2022a, b ). The PLS-SEM method was chosen over CB-SEM because it is suitable for evaluating complex models ( Chin, 1998 ) and useful when constructs have not been sufficiently explored in previous theoretical developments ( Dash & Paul, 2021 ). This approach has proven effective in explaining the effects of variables that determine electric vehicle adoption ( Adu-Gyamfi, Song, Nketiah, et al., 2022; Huang et al., 2021; Moon, 2021 ). The theoretical model was developed around 11 constructs: 3 from NAM — Awareness of Consequences (AC), Problem Awareness (PA), Personal Norm (PN); 5 from TPB — Attitude (A), Descriptive Social Norm (DSN), Injunctive Social Norm (ISN), Fig. 1.

{"page_content": "Perceived Behavioral Control (PBC), Intention (I); and 3 that expand on the merger of both theories — Perceived Financial Risks (PFR), Perceived Performance Risks (PPR), and Willingness to Pay (WTP). Each construct was specified using a reflective measurement model, following the fac - tors noted by Cabeza-Ramírez, S ´anchez-Ca ˜nizares, et al., 2022a, b based on Coltman et al. (2008): construct ’ s indicators are interchangeable, and it ’ s possible to exclude specific items without altering the construct ’ s meaning as long as it maintains adequate reliability. Non-probability sampling techniques were applied, as they are suitable for studying new proposals about relationships or variables that could affect a certain phenomenon (electric vehicle adoption) ( Lehdonvirta et al., 2021; Schreuder et al., 2001 ). Probabilistic sampling was discarded due to the exploratory nature of the study and the incomplete knowledge of the target population framework ( Penn et al., 2023 ). Potential adopters are people who drive regularly and possess a driving license, although they are not necessarily vehicle owners. In most households, one or more vehicles may be shared among different family members for commuting to work, traveling to educational in - stitutions, and performing other daily tasks. More specifically, conve - nience sampling and snowball sampling were used ( Emerson, 2015 ). Both procedures make it possible to connect the potential of social networks in order to simply, cheaply and efficiently access a large set of participants ( Lehdonvirta et al., 2021 ). To this end, a questionnaire was developed using the distinct methods identified in the previously considered literature. The questionnaire addresses the hypotheses generated from the model shown in Fig. 1, in line with the objective and research questions posed at the outset. This sampling technique was chosen as it is not possible to know the number of potential regular drivers adopting an electric vehicle in Spain. This is because, although the Directorate-General for Traffic ( DGT, 2023 ) provides updated in - formation on the driving licenses issued, a group of industry experts indicated that appearing in this database does not guarantee the holder is a regular driver, nor a potential buyer. Examples could include fam - ilies where several members have a driving license, but only one family member drives; or people who get their driving license to improve their job prospects, but do not buy a car or drive until they have sufficient income. 3.1. Data collection and sample design Before collecting the information, the corresponding author ’ s uni - versity ethics committee was consulted to ensure the study was viable and the participants ’ rights were respected. Having confirmed compli - ance with their recommendations, the guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki were checked before starting the fieldwork. The target popu - lation was Spaniards over 18 years of age who are regular car drivers (making at least one trip a week as the driver). To guarantee the highest level of randomness in the responses, no additional limitations were placed on the selection criteria. Before starting the data collection, a first draft of the questionnaire was developed by drawing on the previous literature. Following Jain et al. (2022), we consulted with four external academics and five pro - fessionals from the automotive industry, who evaluated the validity of the content of the questionnaire. Next, a pilot test was carried out using convenience sampling through sharing on Facebook (n = 25). The re - sults were discussed with the group of academics and experts, and following their advice, the questions were reordered and items that could be confusing for future respondents were reworded. The 25 test questionnaires were discarded for the final analysis. The data collection for the final sample was carried out using the SurveyMonkey online tool. A link and a QR code to share the survey were created and posted on Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn and online drivers ’ forums. The survey remained open from November 11, 2021 to February 11, 2022 (a period without any Covid-related mobility restrictions). The post included in - formation on the objective of the study, the rights related to voluntary participation, the guarantee of anonymity and confidentiality, approximate duration (10 – 15 min), and a short text encouraging par - ticipants to share the questionnaire among their circle of contacts. It also informed respondents that clicking on the questionnaire meant they were giving their informed consent to participate in the study. Following this procedure, a total of 1241 valid questionnaires were obtained, from 629 women and 612 men. Table 1 compiles the infor - mation related to the sociodemographic data of the sample.

The ma - jority of the respondents lay within the widest age group of 18 – 30 years old (60.34%) and were mostly people with a higher educational level (62.4% between higher VET and undergraduate, master ’ s or doctorate degree). Among the respondents, people who declared that they were studying predominated (47.25%), as did a monthly household income of less than € 2000 (48.5%). The majority lived with three other people (43.74%), and mostly in two-car households. Regarding the vehicle regularly used by the respondents, the predominant fuel was diesel, followed by gasoline. Only 0.87% claimed to own an electric vehicle, while 5.87% drove a hybrid vehicle. On the other hand, the majority of men and women stated that they had no intention of purchasing a vehicle in the near future (59.97% and 65.61%, respectively). In both cases, the vehicle was used mainly for trips of more than 200 km, although the frequency of these trips ranged less markedly between once a month and once a year. Although 67.97% of the participants had enclosed parking for their vehicle, most declared that it would not be possible to install a charging point in their building (68.27%) or did not have a charging point near their home (80.7%). This demographic dis - tribution aligns with the study ’ s objective of testing a sociopsychological adoption model, including moderating variables. Specifically, the gender distribution is well-balanced. The age demographics include a large group of young people and students, who are potential early adopters of new technologies and whose behaviors and preferences can significantly influence future market trends. This allows for comparisons between younger and older adopters. Recent studies, such as Buhmann and Criado (2023), have used similar samples to determine the influence of sociodemographic variables, car attributes, and external environ - mental factors on consumer psychological variables. 3.2. Measurement instrument and scales In addition to the section on the sociodemographic characteristics of the sample ( Table 1 ), the questionnaire developed specifically for this research was divided into four blocks: the first corresponded to the NAM model constructs (Awareness of Consequences, Problem Awareness, Personal Norm); this was followed by a section including the TPB vari - ables (Descriptive Social Norm, Injunctive Social Norm, Attitude, Perceived Behavioural Control); the third section contained questions about the perceived financial and performance risks; and the last part asked about the dependent variables purchase intention and willingness to pay. As shown in Table 2, the latent variables corresponding to these blocks were measured with a five-point Likert scale adapted from the previous literature (1 totally disagree; 5 totally agree), with the excep - tion of willingness to pay, which was presented as a series of percentages that the potential buyer would be willing to pay on top of the average price of a conventional vehicle (0, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%) ( Table 1 ). The previous table presents the scales used, previously validated with the support of a professional translator who ensured minimal modifications and maintained the comprehensibility of all items in the Spanish context. Items for Awareness of Consequences (AC), Problem Awareness (PA), and Personal Norm (PN) were adapted from Bobeth and Kastner (2020).

{"page_content": "Performance Risk (PPR) were taken from Giansoldati et al. (2020) and Rosales-Tristancho et al. (2022), addressing perceptions of financial and performance concerns. Items for Intention (I) were obtained from Ajzen ’ s study (1991) and various empirical studies ( Asadi et al., 2021; Dong et al., 2020; Hamzah & Tanwir, 2021 ). Finally, items for Will - ingness to Pay (WTP) were adapted by consulting different contexts, including the study by S ´anchez-Ca ˜nizares et al. (2021), which evaluates willingness to pay more for additional safety measures in the COVID-19 context, and the study by Shi et al. (2023), focused on electric vehicles. 4. Results 4.1. Common method bias and multicollinearity test In a step prior to the estimation, it was checked whether the results could be affected by common method bias (CMB) ( Kock & Lynn, 2012 ). To that end, it was corroborated that there was no collinearity or com - mon method bias (CMB), as none of the variance inflation factor (VIF) values surpassed 3.3, which is considered an indication of such issues ( Kock, 2015; Kock & Lynn, 2012 ). Given that none of the latent variables exceeded the limit of 2.90, it was concluded that the results were free of this type of bias. 4.2. Measurement model The theoretical model was evaluated through structural equation modeling (SEM) using partial least squares (PLS) with the SmartPLS 4.0 software. The model ’ s validation was performed by assessing the reli - ability of the individual indicators via their loadings (as shown in Table 2 ). The outer loadings, except for two items, one from perceived financial risk (PFR) and the other from descriptive social norm (DSN), exceeded the 0.707 threshold recommended by Carmines and Zeller (1979). However, both were kept in the model as they belonged to different constructs. Furthermore, these items exceeded the value of 0.4 proposed by Henseler et al. (2009). Table 3 displays the analysis of the constructs ’ internal consistency, as well as their convergent and discriminant validity. To confirm the statistical validity of the outer loadings, a boot - strapping method with 5000 iterations was conducted. The results of the Student t-test showed that all obtained p-values were below 0.01. Table 3 illustrates the reliability and validity measures of the constructs using Cronbach ’ s Alpha, composite reliability (CR), and the average variance extracted (AVE). Apart from perceived financial risk (PFR), all constructs surpassed the recommended threshold for a reliable estima - tion proposed by Nunnally and Bernstein (1994). However, a value of over 0.6 can be considered an acceptable measure of consistency ( Churchill, 1979; Kim et al., 2021; Taber, 2018 ). As far as the convergent validity is concerned, all the constructs exceeded the cut-off of 0.5 established by Fornell and Larcker (1981). Following the indications by Amora (2021) and Henseler et al. (2009), each construct explains a minimum of 50% of the assigned indicators ’ variance. Additionally, discriminant validity was established, as indicated by the bold diagonal entries in Table 3, which represent the variance shared between each construct and its measurements, being higher than the correlations be - tween each construct and the others, ( Hair Jr et al., 2021 ). As additional assurance, the Heterotrait-Monotrait (HTMT) approach was used, which is more sensitive to possible problems with discriminant validity ( Henseler et al., 2016 ). All the HTMT ratio values fell below the 0.90 threshold indicated by Gold et al. (2001), confirming the fit. Addition - ally, a complete bootstrapping was performed to test the null hypothesis HTMT ≥ 1 ( Hair Jr et al., 2021 ). The result showed values equal to or greater than 1, which reinforces the discriminant validity of the model. Therefore, based on the analysis, it was determined that the 11 con - structs of the model were statistically distinct from one another, thus enabling their use in estimating the structural model.

{"page_content": "4.3. Structural model The structural model, path coefficients, and R 2 values ( Hair Jr et al., 2021 ) illustrate the causal relationships among the constructs. This analysis enables the testing of the proposed hypotheses and helps determine if they are supported by the data. Additionally, the R 2 value measures the model ’ s predictive accuracy. As this is a measure used in different disciplines, its interpretation is based on an approximate gen - eral rule. An R 2 of 0.75 or higher is generally considered to represent a substantial value, 0.50 a moderate value, with 0.25 or less being weak ( Hair Jr et al., 2018 ). However, these values are just a guide and should be contextualized to the specific problem and the data used. For example Moroni et al. (2022) states that \"R 2 values of 0.20 are considered high in disciplines such as consumer behaviour ”. Table 4 shows the R 2 values for the endogenous variables ranged between 0.3 and 0.57, except will - ingness to pay with 0.17. As such, the values are considered acceptable for an exploratory model of behaviour ( Cabeza-Ramírez, S ´anchez-Ca ˜nizares, et al., 2022a, b ). Additionally, the predictive rele - vance of the exogenous constructs was calculated from the Q 2 statistic. The values were obtained using a blindfolding procedure, and in all cases they turned out to be strictly positive, thus guaranteeing the pre - dictive significance of the exogenous variables for the corresponding endogenous ones ( Hair Jr et al., 2021 ). Regarding the significance of the path coefficients of the proposed hypotheses, Table 5 and Fig. 2 show the results according to each β i coefficient, along with the p-value of the Student t-test.

{"page_content": "coefficients denote that all hypotheses were supported, except for H14a and H15b. It was not possible to confirm a statistically significant in - fluence of the perception of financial risk on attitudes towards electric vehicles ( H14a ), nor of the perception of performance risk on purchase intention (H15b). Finally, the standardized root mean square residual (SRMR) was calculated, yielding a value of 0.061, which confirmed the goodness of fit of the model, given that Ringle et al. (2009) indicated that this value should be below 0.10. 4.4. PLS-MGA multi-group analysis To conclude the empirical analysis, a multigroup moderation anal - ysis was applied: bootstrap-based multigroup (PLS-MGA) ( Cheah et al., 2023 ). This approach starts out from the assumption of the existence of categorical variables that potentially affect all the relationships of the internal model ( Hair Jr et al., 2014 ). It was used to study the possible influence of seven variables: gender (female/male), age ( > 30 years/ ≤ 30 years), income level ( > € 2000/ ≤ € 2000), possibility of installing a charging point in the building (Yes/No), proximity to a charging point (Yes/No), use of the vehicle (short trips ≤ 200 km/long trips > 200 km), and previous experience with electric or hybrid vehicles (Yes/No). Table 6 shows only the statistically significant relationships found be - tween the different subgroups. Prior to the PLS-MGA procedure, measurement invariance was checked. To ensure accurate comparisons between the various groups regarding the coefficients of the structural model, it was crucial to satisfy this criterion. The measurement invariance of composite models (MICOM) technique was employed. ( Cheah et al., 2020; Henseler et al., 2016 ). The three steps of this procedure can be summarized as follows: assessment of configural invariance, assessment of compositional invariance, and compliance with equality of means and variances across groups. If the first two requirements are met, it indicates partial mea - surement invariance. In this case, we are in position to make compari - sons between path coefficients. Moreover, if the third condition is also met, it is possible to affirm that total measurement invariance is reached. In our case, we use a somewhat more flexible criterion, allowing a maximum of two constructs to not fulfil the requirement of composi - tional invariance (step 2), as other studies have done ( Higueras-Castillo et al., 2019 ). Taking into account this flexibility, partial invariance was confirmed for only four variables (age, income, main use and previous experience). Table 6 shows the coefficients of the structural model restricted to each group, the difference between the two and the significance of the PLS-MGA results using two different procedures, Henseler ’ s MGA, and the Welch-Satterthwaite test ( Henseler et al., 2009; Matthews, 2017 ). It can thus be observed that the influence of the personal norm (PN) on intention (I) is greater in people under 30; in fact, the effect is negative in those over 30. In addition, the effect of the descriptive social norm (DSN) on the injunctive social norm (ISN), as well as intention (I) on will - ingness to pay (WTP), is higher in the older subsample. This last dif - ference turned out to be significant only with the Welch-Satterthwaite test. On the other hand, the injunctive social norm (ISN) has a greater effect on intention (I) in the subgroup earning more than € 2000. Lastly, it can be seen that the descriptive social norm (DSN) has a greater effect on the injunctive social norm (ISN) in the group of people who mainly use their car for long trips, and in those who have previous experience with electric or hybrid vehicles.

Discussion This study aligns with current research that promotes the integration of psychological models to enhance the understanding of consumer purchase behavior ( Adu-Gyamfi, Song, Obuobi, et al., 2022; Asadi et al., 2021; B ¨osehans et al., 2023; Dong et al., 2020; Gunawan et al., 2022; Hamzah & Tanwir, 2021; Huang et al., 2021; Moon, 2021; Th ø gersen & Ebsen, 2019; Tu & Yang, 2019; Vafaei-Zadeh et al., 2022 ). For instance, Dong et al. (2020) demonstrated that the combined predictive power of TPB and NAM surpasses that of individual approaches, based on previ - ous studies that merged these frameworks ( Han & Hyun, 2017; Kim et al., 2018 ). Similarly, Hamzah and Tanwir (2021). Similarly, Hamzah and Tanwir (2021) illustrated that while TPB leans towards self-interest and social approval, NAM focuses on moral obligation, advocating for the integration of both frameworks to overcome limitations in predict - ing environmentally moral behaviors. However, these studies over - looked willingness to pay as an outcome variable and did not consider factors associated with risk perception or the possible heterogeneity effects of demographic and situational variables ( Adnan et al., 2017; Coffman et al., 2017; Kumar & Alok, 2020; Li et al., 2017; Onat & Kucukvar, 2022 ). This work integrates these factors to provide a more holistic understanding of consumer behavior in the adoption of electric vehicles. Our study found significant positive associations between the pro - posed activators (awareness of consequences (AC), awareness of the problem (PA), descriptive social norm (DSN), injunctive social norm Fig. 2.

{"page_content": "(ISN)), and the personal norm (PN), supporting hypotheses 1 to 4. The outcome was expected, as it is consistent with the findings of Bobeth and Kastner (2020), as well as with previous research that combines the TPB and the NAM to study electric vehicles ( Asadi et al., 2021; Dong et al., 2020 ). At the same time, it is consistent with the claims of Kl ¨ockner (2013a) \"personal norms act as an integrating variable for value and norm related aspects, they integrate parts of social norms\". On the other hand, the association between the personal norm and intention was significant, but not as strong as expected, according to the path coefficient (H5). This supports the results of Mohamed et al. (2016) in the context of Canada: environmental awareness can be an important part of a person ’ s interest in buying an electric car, but it is not the decisive construct, since this relationship is mediated by the beliefs linked to the TPB constructs. In the same sense, Liu et al. (2017) explained how, in com - parison with the TPB variables, the personal norm can present a weak relationship. This goes to the complementarity of the two models (NAM-TPB) in providing a holistic view of environmental consumption behaviour ( Asadi et al., 2021; Dong et al., 2020 ). Delving into this premise, the model showed how the effects of the NAM elements were channelled, especially from the respondents ’ beliefs about the aware - ness of the problem and the beneficial repercussions of purchasing an electric vehicle towards their attitudes (H9 and H10 ). This finding offers empirical support to the claim made by Bala et al. (2022): promoting environmental sensitivity through knowledge improves attitudes, and ultimately translates into a stronger intention to engage in pro-environmental behaviour. Furthermore, this supports the basic TPB hypotheses (H6, H8 and H11 ), in line with the meta-analysis of Kumar and Nayak (2022), who found attitude to be the most important ante - cedent of behavioural intention, followed by subjective norms, and then perceived behavioural control. The second relevant finding concerns the associations between intention and willingness to pay ( H12 ), and personal norm and will - ingness to pay ( H13 ). In this respect, our results add to the controversial debate on the proposed relationships between these variables ( Bishop & Barber, 2015; Chen-Yu & Yang, 2020 ). Both variables showed positive and significant links with willingness to pay. However, it is worth noting different experimental studies, including the one by Chen-Yu and Yang (2020), which show how these connections could become insignificant when considering actual willingness to pay. It is thus called into question whether intention is an adequate predictor of willingness to pay; that is, when the time comes to make the actual economic commitment of the purchase. This is known as hypothetical bias, or the inconsistency be - tween what people say they will do and what they actually do (differ - ence between stated and observed actions) ( Bishop & Barber, 2014 ). This effect could even be heightened in the context of behaviours that may be considered socially acceptable ( Bishop & Barber, 2015 ), such as the purchase of an electric vehicle. Nevertheless, in this particular case, both in Spain and in the rest of Europe, a potential adopter must pay an additional amount equivalent to 20% – 50% of the cost of a corre - sponding combustion vehicle ( IEA, 2022 ). Therefore, it seems reason - able to confirm that intention must translate into willingness to pay if the potential adopter really intends to take on the transition to an electric vehicle. In our sample, 37% stated that they planned to purchase a vehicle in the near future, and almost 75% were willing to pay an extra 10% or more for an electric vehicle. And since the average price of electric vehicles in Europe is considerably higher than that of diesel/ - gasoline vehicles ( IEA, 2022 ), our work reinforces the exploratory models based on the TPB and NAM ( Asadi et al., 2021; Dong et al., 2020; Hamzah & Tanwir, 2021 ). Aligning with studies such as those by Hidrue et al. (2011) and Ferguson et al. (2018), which show strong links be - tween the functional attributes of the vehicle (range, charging time, fuel economy, performance), ecological aspects (pollution reduction), and the variable willingness to pay. Therefore, this finding also aligns with the results of the latest reports on European environmental culture, which indicate that citizens of regions with more resources are more willing to take measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

Therefore, this finding also aligns with the results of the latest reports on European environmental culture, which indicate that citizens of regions with more resources are more willing to take measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Conversely, inhabitants of regions with fewer resources and less of an environmental culture are more reluctant to do so, due to an increase in costs that they see as hard to afford in the short term ( Halman et al., 2022; IEA, 2022; Rodríguez, 2021 ). This is reflected in the perception of financial and performance risks as significant barriers to the adoption of electric vehicles in these regions, which supports our hypotheses H1, H2, H5, and H13. In regions with more resources, a greater awareness of environmental consequences and problems (H1 and H2) leads to a higher activation of personal norms, thereby increasing the intention to purchase electric vehicles (H5). Moreover, a greater intention to pur - chase translates into a higher willingness to pay for these vehicles ( H13 ). The third significant finding of this study pertains to the moderating role of demographic and situational variables. Our study confirmed the effects of up to four variables (age, income level, primary use of the vehicle, and prior experience) out of the seven proposed. Specifically, the age of potential adopters moderated adoption perceptions. This finding aligns with previous literature identifying how age influences the ownership of electric vehicles. An example is found in the logistic regression analyses by Westin et al. (2018), who also observed that, alongside age, the most influential factor in ownership was personal norms. Our research confirmed that personal norms have a stronger influence on the purchase intention of younger individuals. Regarding income level, studies such as those by Javid and Nejat (2017) and Li et al. (2017) have identified that household income, along with other factors such as the highest level of education in the household, the buyer ’ s car-sharing status, the density of charging stations, and the regional gasoline price, can significantly affect the adoption of electric vehicles. Our results showed that injunctive social norms and intention have a greater impact on willingness to pay (WTP) among those with higher incomes. This indicates that individuals with higher incomes are more willing to pay for electric vehicles due to their economic capacity, as well as the influence of their social networks and normative expec - tations. The primary use of the vehicle also moderated the relationships within the electric vehicle adoption model. Those who primarily use their vehicles for daily commutes and short trips find electric vehicles more attractive due to their energy efficiency and lower operating costs ( Li et al., 2017 ). In our study, it was found that descriptive social norms have a greater effect on injunctive social norms among those who use the vehicle mainly for long trips. This finding highlights the need to consider how vehicle use can influence social norms that affect the intention to adopt electric vehicles, suggesting that messages emphasizing the effi - ciency and advantages of electric vehicles for long trips can be partic - ularly effective. Finally, prior experience with electric vehicles positively influenced the willingness to adopt this technology. Users who have already had contact or experience with electric vehicles show a greater predisposition to consider purchasing one in the future ( Kumar & Alok, 2020; Li et al., 2017; Tunçel, 2022 ). This finding was supported by our study, where it was found that descriptive social norms (DSN) have a greater effect on injunctive social norms (ISN) among those with prior experience with hybrid or electric vehicles. This suggests that fa - miliarity and comfort with the technology can reduce perceived barriers and increase social acceptance, which in turn reinforces social norms that promote the adoption of electric vehicles. 5.1.

{"page_content": "and the willingness to pay an additional price for an environmentally friendly product ( IEA, 2022 ). Secondly, this study contributes to filling the gap in the knowledge linked to the effects of the social norm on the purchase decision. Consequently, our proposal adheres to the reasoning of Bobeth and Kastner (2020) based on Ajzen (1991), Cialdini et al. (1990) and Minton et al. (2018), who point out that breaking down the social norm into descriptive and injunctive elements offers relevant information about the impact of group norms on the purchase decision. For the case of the transition to electric vehicles, we find that both norms are aligned, and that the descriptive social norm exerts a strong influ - ence on the injunctive social norm (H7). This finding supports the claims of Smith (2020) and Eriksson et al. (2015), who note the importance of recognizing descriptive (that is, what people do) and prescriptive (that is, the influence of personal referents) elements, given that misaligned or conflicting norms within the group can be particu - larly detrimental to participation in desired behaviours. Thirdly, our study represents an advance in the assessment of two notable di - mensions of risk (financial and performance) and their negative influ - ence on attitudes ( H14a, b ), intention ( H15a, b ) and willingness to pay ( H16a, b ). The results did not allow us to confirm the influence of financial risks on attitudes ( H14a ), nor of performance risks on intention (H15b), although the effects of performance risk on attitude (H14b) were confirmed, as was the influence of financial risk on intention ( H15a ), and of both on willingness to pay ( H16a, b ). Looking at the path coefficients, this could indicate that the population seems to be aware of the transition to electric vehicles, and that the influence of these two risks is not as pronounced as might be expected. 5.2. Practical and management implications Spain presents promising data, with a sustained increase in electric vehicle sales, but its speed of change leaves it some way behind the European electric mobility benchmarks (Norway, Iceland, Sweden, the Netherlands, Germany) ( ANFAC, 2022; IEA, 2022 ). From a rational-normative point of view, the application of the model to the study sample reflects the idea that both rational and altruistic motives play a relevant role in investment decision-making ( Bobeth & Kastner, 2020 ). This could be indicative of a favourable inclination towards the transition. However, in the Spanish context, unlike in Germany ( Bobeth & Kastner, 2020 ), the effects of social pressure exert a marked influence (H7), as do attitudes towards electric vehicles generated by the NAM activators ( H11 ). The actions of the Spanish government have mainly focused on offering purchase subsidies, and gradually implementing traffic restrictions in population centres of more than 50,000 inhabitants ( ANFAC, 2022; MTERD, 2021; European Parliament, 2022 ). According to the results, manufacturers and institutions should segment their marketing and communication actions by the age of the potential buyer. The multigroup analysis shows that in the over-30s, intention has a larger influence on willingness to pay, but the environmental moral norm negatively influences intention. Awareness-raising campaigns should therefore be targeted at the older population. Simultaneously, the multigroup analysis also revealed that the influence of one’s sur - roundings (what people do) enhances the effects of the subjective norm (personal referents). This points to the need for communication about the status of electric vehicle infrastructure deployment, for example, by running information campaigns on the availability of charging points, or by extending subsidies for the installation of new charging points. Specifically, this enhances the influence of the subjective norm on the purchase decision, particularly for those drivers who use the vehicle for long journeys and those who have some kind of previous experience with electric or hybrid vehicles. 5.3. Limitations and future lines of research There are certain limitations to this study that present opportunities for further research. First, the data collection technique, convenience sampling in social networks and car forums, could cast doubt on how generalizable the results are. However, as Bobeth and Kastner (2020) pointed out, although the interpretation is limited due to socio-demographic characteristics, the approach used captures valuable information about potential adopters. Therefore, the sample is pertinent to the creation of support strategies and the gradual adoption of sus - tainable mobility practices. Moreover, it opens the door to verifying the directions of causality through probability sampling and by imple - menting an experimental design.

Moreover, it opens the door to verifying the directions of causality through probability sampling and by imple - menting an experimental design. Secondly, we assessed the influence of just two risks (financial and performance); future studies should consider the different variants of perceived risk ( Featherman et al., 2021; Jain et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2018 ). Thirdly, when decomposing the social norm into descriptive and injunctive elements, it is assumed that the second is part of the subjective norm of the standard TPB model. The two roles of the social norm have rarely been used in the field of electric mobility, which creates an opportunity to provide empirical support to the effects found here. Finally, the study has a markedly cross-sectional nature, meaning it captures the influence of rational and altruistic factors in a given context and time. Therefore, future research should implement longitudinal studies that allow an assessment of the evolution of the moral norm, and descriptive and injunctive social norms, as well as offering a view of the progress of the rational elements of the purchase decision as the electric vehicle becomes more widespread. 6. Conclusion This study presented an extended model of the integrated theoretical framework of the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) and the Norm Activation Model (NAM). This model incorporated perceived risk vari - ables and used willingness to pay as a dependent variable. Additionally, it examined how demographic and situational variables influence rational and altruistic elements. The study revealed the connection be - tween purchase intention and willingness to pay. The results confirmed that the intention to purchase an electric vehicle is significantly con - nected to the willingness to pay more for such a vehicle. Specifically, it was found that purchase intention positively influences willingness to pay, verifying that consumers with a higher purchase intention are willing to make a greater economic sacrifice. Regarding the impact of perceived economic and performance risks, it was found that both negatively affect both intention and willingness to pay. However, it was observed that the impact of performance risk on purchase intention is not statistically significant, while financial and performance risks have a significant negative effect on willingness to pay. Finally, regarding the moderation of demographic and situational variables, it was confirmed that these variables moderate the relationships between the psycho - logical constructs of NAM and TPB with purchase intention and will - ingness to pay. Personal norms have a greater influence on purchase intention among younger individuals, while descriptive social norms and intention have a greater impact on willingness to pay among older groups and those with higher incomes. It was also observed that the influence of descriptive social norms (i.e., what people perceive others are doing) on injunctive social norms (i.e., what people perceive others consider correct to do) is stronger in specific groups. This effect is more pronounced in people who primarily use their vehicle for long trips and in those with prior experience with hybrid or electric vehicles. This in - dicates that these groups are more influenced by the perceptions of others’ actions and behaviors when forming their own norms and de - cisions regarding the use of electric vehicles.

Introduction The concept of ‘rurality ’ is itself unclear and often contextual, as pointed out by ( Hardy et al., 2019 ), ( Hardy et al., 2018 ). Yet the issues of proximity, demographics, and other social factors remain relatively unchanged throughout different definitions. In this special issue, there is no precise definition of rurality, since such definitions would be mean - ingless as rurality in Europe has different connotation than rurality in Africa. Also, between countries within regions, such as Southeast Asia, the concept of rurality is not identical. For example, in the United States, [x1] identifies three different definitions of rurality. The Eurostat uses a technical definition based on population density: less than 300 in - habitants per 1 km 2. Correspondingly, an area is considered urban when the density exceeds 300 inhabitants per square kilometer ( Eurostat, 2018 ). Rural communities and regions face specific challenges in terms of thin markets, low population density, and long distances. Also, the de - mographics of these communities are often skewed towards the elderly, and the socioeconomics is characterized by higher share of low-income populations. While the concept of urban smart communities is quite well established, e.g. Smart Cities ( Silva et al., 2018 ), ( Batty et al., 2012 ), the concept of smart rural region communities is only beginning to gain scholarly attention. Smart rural communities can be understood as rural areas and communities that build on their existing strengths and assets as well as on developing new opportunities based on the aforementioned. Tradi - tional and new networks and services can be improved by utilizing digital telecommunication technologies, innovations, and better use of data and knowledge to benefit the communities. Investing in both physical and digital connectivity, and building digital environments for innovative services, economic sustainability, jobs, and social capital can be enhanced, thus contributing to active and live rural communities.

{"page_content": "Consequently, the development of smart rural communities and regions begins to emerge in research ( Naldi et al., 2015 ). What is becoming evident is that achieving the ambitions of smart rural communities re - quires not only digital technologies but also innovation of commercial and social services, as well as better digital capabilities and skills to bridge the existing – and in places the widening - divide between rural and urban communities. Research suggests community-centered approaches, emphasizing that sustainable living in rural areas cannot be achieved only through technology ( Irwansyah, 2020 ). To ensure the sustainability, effective - ness, and usability of new solutions in the long term, the process must be started, adapted, and led by local actors following their actual needs. Learning from smart city research, the involvement of key stakeholders in the process is one of the keys. With a focus in the community, research is also beginning to question the dichotomy between smart cities and smart rural areas. There is a valid argument that many regions in the world are more characterized by towns and villages rather than large mega-cities, the challenges and opportunities of which differ (at least to some extent) from rural areas. Also, the trends in urban and spatial planning under digital transformation call for greater focus on sustain - able development ( Henriksen et al., 2021 ). The rural challenges occur commonly across the world as the papers in this special issue indicate. In Europe, the rural areas are home to 137 million people representing almost 30% of its population and over 80% of its areal territory, when considering all communes and municipalities of the European Union having low population size or density ( Eurostat, 2023 ). Despite the social aspects related to demographics, economics, and education, much of the research and development has been related to technology and its incorporation in rural areas to improve digital connectivity. Obviously, this is one of the critical issues to keep rural communities from further losing their population ( Rosario et al., 2021 ). Although the pandemic (COVID-19) caused some reverse population shifts in places, the big picture of urbanization has not changed ( Halfacree, 2024 ). Rural challenges have been recognized by high-level policymakers and actions have been taken. For example, between 2021 and 2024 the European Commission has financed more than 60 research and inno - vation projects with a total worth of more than € 250 million ( European Commission ). The objective is to keep the rural economies alive by primarily promoting jobs, but also enhancing social inclusion and sense of community. Many of the research actions have been linked with agriculture and farming (thus related to Common Agriculture Policy, CAP) such as social farming as a value-added function on top of tradi - tional farming ( Sgroi, 2022 ). The idea is not to rely solely on technology, but to invest in social capital and have a sense of identity and common purpose ( Falk & Kilpatrick, 2000 ). Table 1 Overview of the accepted articles.

{"page_content": "The call for papers for this virtual special issue (VSI) was launched in 2022, right after the COVID-19 pandemic had lost its grip on the world. VSI ” Towards smart, digitalized rural regions and communities – pol - icies, best practices, and case studies ” was initiated by a group of re - searchers that had just begun a new European project ” Architecture for Unified Regional and Open Digital Ecosystems for Smart Communities and Rural Areas Large Scale Application ” (AURORAL). The project was funded by the European Commission under the Horizon 2020 research program ( https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101016854 ), an example of the aforementioned research and innovation actions. After two years of research contributions and reviewing the vast number of manuscripts, the compiled VSI is published. Out of more than 70 original research manuscripts 17 were finally accepted for publica - tion. The details of the accepted papers including the title, keywords, authors list and country are given in Table 1. Thematically, the article collection was diversified into several topical areas (see Fig. 1 ). Digital transformation of rural areas was the most common topic touched on by the researchers. Also, the digital divide between rural and urban areas received high attention. It is noteworthy that rural issues cover all types of economies and countries: highly industrialized and developed countries from Scandinavia, tech - nology giants ’ home base countries from Northern America, fast- growing Asian economies, and countries that can still be considered as emerging economies. Therefore, we can consider that rural issues do not respect any economic, social, or geographical boundaries but are truly of global concern. 2. Paper contributions The VSI starts with an Opinion Paper delivered by G ´omez-Carmona et al. introducing the AURORAL platform concept that was demon - strated in the respective European project and in multiple pilot locations across the European Union. The fundamental idea of the platform is to provide digital connectivity crossing the domain boundaries, thus creating a sufficient economy of scale that the rural areas often lack. Similar digital tools, but more specific in terms of domain setting, were introduced by Zhou et al., in the small Chinese village of Beiqishui, where the WeChat platform was successfully adopted by villagers making them economically more active and self-aware. Ong et al. report how digital payment systems are affected by behavioral factors, espe - cially in rural areas. Liu et al. propose an open digital ecosystem for energy retrofits, using a case study from Sweden. Finally, Anand et al. show how a fishing community in Kerala, India, co-designed a multi- purpose digital ecosystem serving the community needs and internal communications. The digital divide is inherently present especially in rural areas but also regarding different citizen segments, such as socio-economically disadvantaged and elderly. Wang et al. analyze the psychological digi - tal divide among the elderly in rural China. The combination of dividing factors may lead to increasing deprivation. Adopting smart systems and tools is naturally affected by the digital divide, as reported by Dixit et al. when they search for factors that influence adopting smart farming methods. More generally, Cho and Park find that cultural and social factors are key elements of successfully bridging the digital divide, as they present their Korean case study. Therefore, empowering the local communities should be a part of rural support measures. This is also underlined by Lapuz, as local communities are facilitated to actively take part in tourism development. Furthermore, there is the question of trust in the technology and those who manage and govern the tech - nologies, as pointed out by Johnson in the case of the digitalization of Jamaican agriculture. The lack of infrastructure (both digital and physical) is one of the dividing issues why rural areas are handicapped almost without exception. However, local activism may pay off well, as demonstrated by Huang, showing how Dalles County was able to persuade Google to establish its first data center in their county. Infrastructures need to be reliable and secure, and security technologies such as blockchains may be one option to assure security, as suggested by Gkogkos. In addition to infrastructures, there is a need for working operating and business models on how to make ‘smart ’ realized. This is highlighted by Junca et al. when they study energy community business models in the Med - iterranean.

Smartness is not only about digitalization, but being able to make use of existing, non-high-tech, resources. This is shown by Samadhiya and Agrawal who study how design-thinking was used to improve the use of hand-loom machines in rural India. Smartness should lead to sustain - ability too, and this is demonstrated by Hussain et al. by developing a sustainability indicator framework for smart tourism and mobility. 3. Conclusion and acknowledgments In sum, the papers included in this VSI manifest that the social dimension of technology - especially digital technologies - does call for more research. We need to understand how technology is deployed and put into use to better serve the communities, including the rural and disadvantaged. It would be misleading to assume that simply intro - ducing more technologies to rural communities and populations is progress per se. This is not to say that we should underestimate the prospects of new technologies, either. If not earlier, it was the Covid-19 pandemic that proved the power of digital connectivity, allowing people to work remotely and keeping things running and societies functioning. This special issue has policies, best practices and case studies mentioned in its title. Most of the published articles can be categorized as case studies, showing examples of how rural communities have entered the digital age and how they have applied digital opportunities in many ways. With respect to policies that would be generalizable globally, the examples are few if any. The characteristics of rural com - munities, their state of maturity in digital skills and infrastructure are so diverse that universal policies are in practice impossible to identify. This means that - as painful it might be to acknowledge - silver bullets do not exist. At least not yet as far as researchers can see. Government support, subsidies, skills development through educational activities are all on the list, but this is something that has already been intuitively quite well recognized by policymakers. Also, with regards to best practices, the same dilemma remains: it seems somewhat overoptimistic to anticipate that the examples brought forth by the case studies could be transferred from one context to another. However, we should not underestimate the value of encouraging case studies. They do demonstrate that there are solutions, opportunities and valuable lessons to be learned, across the whole spectrum of different types of rural contexts. Delayed, as is often the case with academic deliverables, but proud and happy we are finally able to publish this VSI. We would like to extend our sincerest thanks and gratitude to all the researchers who invested their precious time to contribute to this VSI – without re - searchers there would not be any research, and without research, there is less expectation for progress and reflection to the progress that may have taken place. The anonymous reviewers are likewise gratefully acknowledged – they made a great effort to intensify the quality of the included manuscripts. We also thank the invaluable support and advice given by Technology in Society Editors, the journal publisher ’ s editorial staff, and of course the European Commission through its grant no. 101016854 providing us and all the authors the possibility to address the multiple challenges faced by rural communities and regions. We hope that some of the research results will find their way to policy making and formulation of effective practices for those decision-makers who deal with rural issues.

By systematically analyzing and synthesizing 100 papers from Elsevier ’ s Scopus and Web of Science databases, this review uncovers and interprets their interconnections. We employed Multiple Correspondence Analysis to highlight the theoretical foundations and main research themes. This methodological approach facilitates the visualization of the foundational intellectual structure and the identi - fication of new research opportunities, thereby fostering further synthesis and advancement. Following the analysis of the selected papers and in response to the need for a framework focusing exclusively on empirical studies, we developed an Antecedents-Drivers-Outcomes (ADO) framework based on empirical evidence from a sub-sample of 88 manuscripts. Based on the results of the multiple correspondence analysis and evaluations of empirical papers, this review outlines main theoretical foundations related to resource-based views, network and learning perspectives, and dynamic capabilities. It also identifies major research themes, including organiza - tional culture, human capital empowerment, and development processes. Furthermore, the article highlights gaps and future research opportunities within these intersecting domains, acknowledges advancements in radical and process technological innovation, such as artificial intelligence and machine learning, and provides an overview of the latest developments. 1. Introduction A firm ’ s internal dynamics comprise diverse elements such as stra - tegies, structures, processes, culture, and people. Together, these form the necessary resource base for efficient and sustainable organizational functioning [ 1 ]. Firms ’ internal dynamics, particularly human resource practices combined with absorptive capacity, largely determine orga - nizational innovativeness and the adoption of innovative solutions [ 2, 3 ]. West and Farr [ 4 ] signaled the importance of internal dynamics, as in their perspective innovation occurs at multiple organizational levels and is based on employees ’ capabilities and human resource practices. In particular, human resources practices such as workgroups, planned job rotation, and changes in governance accountability, among others, represent a fundamental part of internal dynamics [ 5 ]. This recognition is associated with the critical role of individuals in adopting, assimi - lating, and exploiting new knowledge and technology to foster innovation [ 6 ]. A large body of scholarly work recognized that human resources practices can enhance innovation performance [ 7 – 9 ]. In particular, some authors portrayed that human resources practices combined with absorptive capacity are essential dynamic capabilities that enable or - ganizations to leverage external knowledge for innovation [ 10 ]. This is especially important because absorptive capacity relates to innovative - ness as \"an organization ’ s proficiency in identifying, assimilating, and effectively applying new knowledge, information, and external re - sources to enhance its performance and adapt to evolving circum - stances ” ([ 11 ]; p. 128). Accordingly, absorptive capacity is viewed as a dynamic capability that encompasses acquiring new knowledge and information, assimilating, converting, and effectively utilizing it to drive innovation [ 12 ]. As such, noting the complementarity of internal capability and external collaboration, absorptive capacity has been pinpointed as a critical catalyst for gaining a competitive edge and * Corresponding author.

{"page_content": "fostering innovation [ 13, 14 ]. To date, empirical research has found that organizational mechanisms with coordinating capabilities (e.g., cross-functional interfaces, decision-making, and job rotation) signifi - cantly impact the acquisition and assimilation of knowledge [ 15 ]. Along those lines, Bogers et al. [ 16 ] and Yildiz et al. [ 17 ] highlighted indi - vidual absorptive capacity and goal orientation level (e.g., learning orientation, prove orientation, avoid orientation) as well as character - istics (e.g., education background) as drivers of innovations within firms. However, despite the growing recognition of internal dynamics and the importance of integrating human resource practices and absorptive capacity toward explaining innovativeness and adoption of innovative solutions, a gap remains in scholarly efforts to synthesize, interpret, and shed light on their interconnection. Therefore, this study aims to portray scholarly contributions addressing this interplay and answer: What is the current state of research on the intersection of human resource practices, absorptive capacity, and innovation, and what gaps or future research opportunities exist in this domain providing the state of the art in these research areas? Purposefully, this study employs a comprehensive and robust sys - tematic literature review to address the apparent gaps in synthesizing and interpreting the interconnectedness among these domains. We have employed a combined narrative and content literature review method - ology to delve into the intersection of these domains. This approach has allowed us to underscore the complex relationship between human resource practices and absorptive capacity. Additionally, through an in- depth analysis of empirical work, we demonstrate how these practices, combined with key roles at various organizational levels, enhance an organization ’ s ability to absorb, apply, and leverage external knowl - edge. Furthermore, our effort uncovers the underlying themes con - necting human resource practices and absorptive capacity, ultimately advancing innovation. The remainder of this review begins with a portrayal of the in - tersection ’ s emergence and positions the review within the context of prior studies. Next, the methodology section provides a detailed over - view of research methods, data collection processes, and analysis tech - niques. The results are then presented in two main subsections: the first offers a descriptive overview, while the second provides an in-depth interpretation of the theoretical foundations, major research themes, and a synthesis of empirical studies. This section highlights practices that emerged from the literature through causal Antecedents-Drivers- Outcomes (ADO) frameworks. Following this, the review identifies numerous research gaps, suggesting theoretical and managerial impli - cations and fruitful avenues for future investigation. 2. Emergence of the fields intersection and prior reviews To address challenges and cope with turmoil environments, firms embrace adaptive, absorptive, and innovative practices to employ, reconfigure and redeploy competencies and resources [ 18, 19 ]. As such, the notion of internal dynamics ’ relevance is several decades old and began to gain significant traction with seminal research developed by Cohen and Levinthal [ 11 ] (see Fig. 1 ). Cohen and Levinthal [ 11 ] spe - cifically examined the communication structures among subunits and the nature and dissemination of expertise within a company. They concluded that essential aspects of innovative organizations include assimilating external knowledge and effectively managing employees, ultimately aiding in developing new products and processes. While this foundational research enhanced our understanding of knowledge assimilation within firms, subsequent studies encountered challenges in translating this concept into a practical framework applicable across various industries (see note by Ref. [ 20 ]). Duchek [ 21 ] also recognized this opportunity for further refinement. However, despite follow-up reviews and notes emphasizing the need for structured stepwise models and systematic interpretation, there remains a gap in depicting the intersection between human resource practices, absorptive capacity, and innovation. Furthermore, recognizing the relevance of knowledge residing outside of organizational boundaries, Cockburn and Henderson [ 22 ] explored the concept of \"connectedness\" among employees and the external environment (e.g., co-authorships and openness to collaborate with employees from other institutions), emphasizing employees ’ per - formance and collaborations with associates outside the organization. Furthering the relevance of connectedness and collaboration, Tsai [ 23 ] explored communication within \"intraorganizational network\" units and the importance of firm network position to access knowledge through networks inside the firm, highlighting the importance of sharing firm-specific knowledge within organizations. While this represented an evolutionary shift in human resource practices, emphasizing the importance of intraorganizational networks, it was still scarce to illus - trate a cohesive strategy that would leverage network structures to foster and promote innovation.

[ 15 ] demonstrated how links be - tween specific organizational mechanisms, such as participation in decision-making, formalization, and routinization, can enhance firm performance. Even when considering specific organizational mecha - nisms (e.g., Ref. [ 15, 23 ]), organizational antecedents like organiza - tional culture and the development process driven by absorptive capacity have often been overlooked. Consequently, despite references to human resource practices (e.g., involvement and communication), there remains a research gap highlighting the need to develop a model, such as the Antecedent, Decision, and Output (ADO) framework. Next, Vinding [ 24 ] demonstrated that companies that value human capital and implement practices like fostering closer relationships with vertically aligned entities and knowledge institutions are better posi - tioned to innovate. Also, Minbaeva [ 25 ] discovered that employees ’ abilities and incentives to absorb knowledge are important determinants in a firm ’ s absorptive capacity and that knowledge-related human resource management strategies (e.g., staffing, training, compensation, promotion, and appraisal) can improve absorptive capacities and lead to organizational innovativeness. Von Ledebur [ 26 ] and Kang [ 27 ] argued that creating an empowering work environment improves social re - lations and encourages employees to increase knowledge transfer across different employee groups. This approach yielded the benefits of increased dynamic capability and innovation, ultimately enhancing the firm ’ s productivity. Furthermore, Weeks et al. [ 28 ] recognized the importance of outsourcing for increasing innovation. However, they cautioned that firms must maintain firm-specific business process knowledge, optimize team sizes when collaborating with suppliers, and manage legacy hiring to sustain innovativeness. Wang and Chen [ 29 ] further developed a systems approach by linking a high-performance work system of human resource practices (e.g., staffing, training, knowledge and skill-based rewards, and team development) with intellectual capital, highlighting its overall focus on development and innovation. Concerning reviews, Lin and Sanders [ 30 ] synthesized literature on HRM – the innovation relationship through the lens of the 4I organiza - tional learning framework (e.g., intuiting, interpreting, integrating, and institutionalizing). In particular, they portrayed a single organizational learning framework and revealed how human resource practices stim - ulate innovation at various levels. To illustrate this multilevel perspec - tive, they assessed forty empirical studies. Their review highlighted that individual, team, and organizational learning moderate the relationship between HRM and innovation. In particular, they noted that a flexible human capital pool regarding resource availability and coordination is more likely to foster innovation at each level. However, Lin and Sanders noted that the aim of their review was not a systematic overview of the domain intersection and that their review is not indeed comprehensive, B. Malisi ´c et al.

{"page_content": "calling for further synthesis and a broader overview of the domain. Subsequently, Hong et al. [ 31 ] conducted a literature review to illustrate how collaborative-based human resource practices help address barriers to open innovation. Their findings revealed that recruiting for teamwork, team-oriented appraisals, rewards, and other related practices foster a collaborative culture and enhance skills that promote knowledge exchange across organizational borders. Recent evaluations underscore the significance of innovation-driven human resource practices. For instance, Lenart-Gansiniec et al. [ 32 ] organized literature on such human resource practices — including recruitment and selection, training and development, compensation, and performance appraisal — and created an integrative frame - work/model that encompasses key antecedents (both internal and external), mediators/moderators, and main outcomes. This study pro - posed a model for future research addressing a multilevel approach - — considering individual, team, and organizational perspectives on innovation-driven human resource practices — providing insights into the current knowledge landscape and elucidating conceptual and methodological issues. In their investigation into agile innovation, Martinez-Sanchez and Vicente-Oliva [ 33 ] analyzed the firm ’ s human resource flexibility and absorptive capacity in agile innovation compared to traditional stage-gate innovation. Their findings revealed that internal human resource practices, particularly the training of core full-time R & D em - ployees, significantly enhance innovation. On another note, the contri - bution of external human resource practices, such as hiring low-knowledge temporary employees, caused adverse effects. Howev - er, the authors noted that further studies are needed to validate and explore these relationships in more depth. Over time, scholars and practitioners have developed practices such as involvement in communication, job influence and challenge, career development, and opportunities for advancement to support innovation at various levels and influence absorptive capacity. However, while understanding internal dynamics and domains of human resource practices, absorptive capacity, and innovation intersection has pro - gressed significantly, market dynamics and ongoing changes have caused continuous development and further complexity. Therefore, there is notable dispersion in the research field in light of the increased and continuously evolving recognition of human resource practices and their linkage with absorptive capacity and innovation. This scattered - ness further highlights the need to examine the effects of human resource practices, absorptive capacity processes, and innovation interconnection, indicating a theoretical and empirical gap that war - rants additional investigation.

{"page_content": "3. Methodology 3.1. Research method and data collection process This review paper addresses the gaps in synthesizing and interpret - ing the interconnectedness between human resource practices, absorp - tive capacity, and innovation (Fernandes et al., 2018). To achieve this, we have adopted a hybrid-narrative approach that allows us to generate new theoretical perspectives and implications at the intersection of these domains [ 34 ]. Our systematic literature review process began with examining previous reviews and conceptualizations on the topic (e.g., Ref. [ 5, 30, 32 ]). To conduct a comprehensive cross-disciplinary review, we designed a research query to identify papers discussing the intercon - nectedness among human resource practices, absorptive capacity, and the innovation domain. Additionally, to ensure the robustness and quality of the review, we focused our search on peer-reviewed journals [ 35 ]. As a result, the search query has been structured around key terms in human resource practices, absorptive capacity, and innovation (the exact search query is provided in Fig. 2 ). We included articles, reviews, and editorials as relevant contributions on the topic that have been published in various forms without any restriction on the publishing year. We ran the first collection process in databases Elsevier ’ s Scopus and Web of Science [ 36 ] on the July 27, 2023, with regular updates until the 31st of December of 2023, retrieving a raw dataset of five-hundred and six papers [Steps 1 – 3 in Fig. 2 ]. After eliminating duplicates and mis-indexed manuscripts from database providers, we conducted an in-depth screening and annotation of the initial selection of four hun - dred and twenty-three papers. This process involved primarily reading the abstracts, followed by full-text reading. Through informed discus - sions among the authors, we selected a final sample of one hundred papers. The inter-rater reliability during the paper development, from the initial selection of manuscripts to the content analysis and codebook development, was 82 %, indicating an adequate agreement among the authors. 3.2. Data analysis To review the literature, we employed several complementary ap - proaches by combining a narrative review [ 37 ] with content analysis [ 38 ] and incorporating a framework to guide future research directions (e.g., Ref. [ 39 ]). In order to highlight the theoretical foundations and principal research themes, which in turn helps researchers visualize the underlying intellectual structure and identify further research oppor - tunities, we adopted Multiple Correspondence Analysis. Our multi-review hybrid approach enables further synthesis and develop - ment of the research domain [ 40 ]. Considering the need for a guiding framework in our analysis, and after having re-read the one hundred selected papers, we constructed an Antecedents-Drivers-Outcome framework [ 39 ] grounded on the empir - ical scholarly evidence of a restricted sample containing eighty-eight manuscripts. Our illustration of the intellectual domain (see Fig. 5 ) and ADO framework (see Fig. 6 ), presented and discussed in the next section, allowed the analysis of the literature and served as a spring - board for further development of the field. The authors assigned each paper to the constituents of the ADO framework by reading the restricted sample of articles focused on empirical studies. Finally, once the eighty-eight papers had been allocated inside the framework, the authors discussed the fundamental characteristics of the papers included in each segment, summing up the shared vital similarities of the studies [ 41 ]. 3.3. Multiple correspondence analysis To map the intersection of research fields and highlight their theo - retical foundations and principal research themes, we employed Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA) [ 36 ]. MCA is a methodolog - ical approach used to discover links between dichotomous variables by assigning a value of \"1 ″ if a term occurred and \"0 ″ otherwise [ 42 ]. In line with the goals of this study, we conducted Homogeneity Analysis by Means of Alternating Least Squares (HOMALS) using SPSS software (v. 26). This allowed us to illustrate the intellectual structure of the research field. The proximity of descriptors in the 2x2 map (see Fig. 5 ) corre - sponded to shared components [ 43 ]. Essentially, the most frequent de - scriptors (i.e., those researched in a larger number of articles) were positioned closer to the center of the map, while similar descr - iptors — referring to a large proportion of articles involving similar top - ics — were positioned near each other [ 44 ]. This method is recognized as a reliable approach to content analysis, enabling the mapping of the structure of various research domains and their intersections, such as coopetition and innovation [ 45 ], and artificial intelligence and mar - keting [ 38 ], among others.

Building upon the pivotal studies and reviews in Section 2, the authors developed the final codebook, which comprised 231 terms categorized into four - teen descriptors. Following multiple informed discussions among the authors and consultation with an external expert in the field, these de - scriptors were categorized into two primary groups based on their characteristics: theoretical approaches and frameworks and major research themes and topics. A comprehensive list of keywords and de - scriptors is provided in the supplementary material. 4. Results 4.1. Descriptive overview of relevant literature Over the past years, there has been a noticeable academic interest in the intersection of human resource practices, absorptive capacity, and innovation among scholars from various domains. For example, the manuscripts were primarily published in journals within the domain of innovation (e.g., Technovation), Human Resources (e.g., Human Resource Management and International Journal of Human Resource Management) and broad management journals (e.g., Journal of Business Research; Journal of Knowledge Management; Management Decision) with around 60 % of articles being published in the period from 2018 to 2023, which in turn calls for a systematic organization of the intersec - tion of the fields [ 47 ] (see Fig. 3 ). Specifically, numerous studies have highlighted the importance of human resources practices, alongside individual knowledge develop - ment, learning, and absorptive capacity, as key drivers of organizational innovativeness. Recognizing that the domain intersection builds upon established fields and in light of the increasing interest among practi - tioners, the literature does exhibit a predominance of quantitative and qualitative studies (see Fig. 4 ). The increased interest can be partly explained by special issues published in academic journals, such as Management Decision [ 48 ], and the recognition of human resources practices as well as the need to transition from Industry 4.0 to Industry 5.0, which focuses more on being human-centered. The ongoing globalization and intensification of technology development and diffusion processes have also increased the importance of the necessity for innovation-driven human resources practices and knowledge transfer within and among firms. Namely, the new paradigm encouraged practitioners and researchers to study this topic from different perspectives, focusing on specific and B. Malisi ´c et al.

Theoretical approaches A literature review reveals that research in the intersection of these domains is dominated by single-level and single-industry contexts, guided by divergent theories and frameworks [ 30 ]. This disparate literature leaves researchers with a fragmented understanding, high - lighting the need for systematic analysis and a comprehensive perspective across various disciplinary fields. The need for a structured approach is addressed by graphically depicting the intellectual structure, starting with labeling the poles outlined by L ´opez-Duarte et al. [ 49 ]. This labeling process, based on informed discussion among authors, relies on the most extreme-located descriptors and their frequency within each category. Table 1 shows the labels, representative descriptors, and manuscripts illustrating the poles. The variance explained by each pole is 25.24 %. However, this can be misleading as the map combines fourteen descriptors into two di - mensions [ 49 ]. According to Hair et al. [ 61 ] and Furrer et al. [ 62 ], variance can distort MCA results, and the overall mean of keywords per article — should be above 1 — is more significant. In our study, it was 1.24. 4.2.1. Resource-based view The resource-based view (RBV) is the most frequently employed theory in research on firm internal dynamics, focusing on the intersec - tion of human resource practices, absorptive capacity, and innovative performance. The RBV attributes differences in performance across firms to the heterogeneity of their resources and capabilities [ 63 ].

{"page_content": "resource practices, indicating that implementing human resource prac - tices like R & D cooperation, high-performing work systems, learning-oriented processes, and training can enhance innovation per - formance [ 7 – 9 ]. Furthermore, within the RBV framework, human resource practices focus on key knowledge personnel, such as project team members who contribute to project performance, supporting previous findings in relevant contexts [ 64 ]. Mehralian et al. [ 6 ] stated, \"an effective HR system should recognize employees as valuable resources for innovation and translate these resources into enduring and competitive capabilities for the firm.\" Through our literature review and MCA analysis, we observed that the resource-based view is often paired with the absorp - tive capacity perspective and the behavioral-cognitive view, which facilitate an understanding of human resource practices and their in - fluence on organizational innovation (see Fig. 5 ). Broadly, RBV un - derscores the significance of cultivating unique employee skills and competencies to attain a competitive advantage. In alignment with this perspective, human resource practices prioritize investment in training and development to enhance human capital and promote a supportive organizational culture. Organizations foster innovative solutions and sustain a competitive edge by developing distinctive resources through a skilled workforce and a positive work environment. 4.2.2. Knowledge-based view In this era of rapidly changing technology, firms are making signif - icant efforts to expand their knowledge reservoirs, allowing them to gain an advantage through increased creativity and the generation of new ideas and innovations. By confirming a significant relationship between a company ’ s knowledge stock and innovation strategy, Sung and Choi [ 3 ] demonstrated the importance of aligning management systems with business strategy. Results on the map ( Fig. 5 ) showed that the knowledge-based view is close to the intellectual capital view, the absorptive capacity perspective, the dynamic view, and organizational innovation. This statement demonstrates that the knowledge-based perspective is frequently a crucial foundation, integrated with the in - tellectual capital framework and absorptive capacity, to reveal knowledge-intensive human resource practices and knowledge transfer. For example, in the Khaksar et al. [ 65 ] study, knowledge workers were greatly influenced by knowledge-based dynamic capabilities. This in - dicates that managers must develop norms and routines to sustain external knowledge absorption among their knowledge workers. Furthermore, a key concept of the knowledge-based perspective is that teams and organizations working in knowledge-intensive environments can improve performance through human resource systems tailored to their specific knowledge needs and performance demands. In particular, human resources practices designed for knowledge-intensive settings enhance knowledge exploration, supporting team knowledge exploita - tion [ 66, 67 ]. The Knowledge-Based View highlights knowledge sharing and collaboration as crucial for innovation. Human resource management within this framework develops systems to capture and share knowl - edge, promoting continuous learning and adaptability. By fostering collective intelligence, organizations boost creativity, generate new ideas, and improve problem-solving, enhancing innovation and adapt - ability in dynamic markets. 4.2.3. Learning perspective Organizational learning is a dynamic process propelled by individual learning and robust social relationships. This process results in structural and cultural modifications that enhance adaptability and promote innovation. In particular, Bornemann et al. [ 68 ] assert that organiza - tional learning originates from individual learning processes, leading to organizational structure and culture changes to ensure survival in a dynamic environment. The authors examine how managers and tech - nical experts manage organizational learning mechanisms and absorp - tive capacity to foster firm innovativeness. In their view, the organization ’ s capacity for learning and transformation is crucial, with employee learning processes significantly generating new ideas and innovation [ 69, 55 ]. These learning processes interact with combinative capabilities, explaining how a company organizes, shares, and manages knowledge [ 70 ]. Kang et al. [ 27 ] emphasized that organizational learning is a key driver of value creation, discovering that strong employee social re - lationships enable effective knowledge transfer and enhance organiza - tional learning. Scholars largely agree that organizational learning in knowledge management can influence dynamic capabilities — such as absorptive capacity, information sharing, and change manage - ment — and ultimately enhance firm performance [ 71 – 73 ]. By efficiently managing knowledge-sharing mechanisms and absorptive capacity, or - ganizations can improve their ability to generate new ideas and ulti - mately enhance value creation. 4.2.4. Network view From a network perspective, a firm ’ s absorptive capacity can be enhanced through investments in human capital, organizational rou - tines, and network development and ties [ 9, 69, 74 ]. Specifically, this involves how well an organization is positioned within its network to access knowledge and its capability to learn and effectively utilize that knowledge from inter- and intra-firm relationships [ 75 ].

{"page_content": "technological and open innovation by enabling organizations to leverage networks, share knowledge, and foster collaboration, enhancing performance and developing innovative products, processes, and services. 4.2.5. Behavioral and cognitive view Scholars regard human resources practices as the primary means by which firms shape and develop employees ’ skills, attitudes, and be - haviors. These practices help employees perform effectively, innovate successfully, and achieve the organization ’ s intended goals, enhancing their innovative performance [ 5, 69, 76 ]. As illustrated in Fig. 5, the literature emphasizes both cognitive and non-cognitive human capital elements and behaviors in influencing organizational competitiveness and innovation [ 77 – 81 ]). From a cognitive perspective, human capital integrating advanced cognitive components — such as knowledge, skills, and experi - ences — and sufficient non-cognitive attributes — such as personality, values, and interests — is essential for fostering the complete array of organizational capabilities required for sustained competitive advan - tage and innovative performance. By strategically aligning human resource practices to optimize these elements, organizations enable employees to perform optimally, drive successful innovation, and contribute to long-term competitive advantage and innovation. 4.2.6. Dynamic capability view Dynamic capability has been defined as \"the firm ’ s ability to inte - grate, build, and reconfigure internal and external competencies to address rapidly changing environments\" ([ 18 ], p. 516) or as \"the firm ’ s processes that use resources — specifically, the processes to integrate, reconfigure, gain, and release resources — to match or even create mar - ket change\" ([ 82 ], p. 1107). Additionally, Cheng and Chen [ 52 ] describe dynamic innovation capabilities as operational capabilities encompass - ing organizational learning processes and routines based on innovation knowledge. These involve transforming a firm ’ s resources and routines associated with innovation knowledge. The results of our analysis (see Fig. 5 ) show that the dynamic capability view is closely related to other theoretical approaches — the knowledge-based view, learning perspec - tive, intellectual view, and resource-based view. From the dynamic capability perspective, individuals are seen as drivers of firm human capital development by maximizing education and skills development to achieve career success — a process facilitated by organizational struc - tures and behaviors, including a learning-oriented culture [ 6, 55, 83 ]. In this view, human resource practices are crucial in cultivating a sup - portive, learning-oriented culture. Specifically, these practices enhance the capacity to respond effectively to dynamic environments by unlocking the intrinsic value of knowledge. The perspectives of dynamic capability and absorptive capacity collectively highlight human resource practices as a vital enabler of innovation. 4.2.7. Absorptive capacity perspective Absorptive capacity refers to an organization ’ s ability to effectively assimilate and utilize transferred knowledge. A higher absorptive ca - pacity empowers an organization to understand received knowledge and unlock its intrinsic value. As a critical dynamic capability, absorptive capacity allows organizations to leverage external knowledge for inno - vation [ 10 ]. According to the results in Fig. 5, the absorptive capacity perspective is closely aligned with other theoretical approaches, including resource-based, knowledge-based, dynamic capability, intel - lectual capital, and organizational innovation. From the resource-based perspective, firms must recognize their re - sources and capabilities, particularly employees ’ abilities to learn, assimilate, and acquire new knowledge. Scholars have noted that by adopting innovation-oriented human resources practices, firms signifi - cantly enhance their competitive advantage and innovative behavior [ 12, 84 ]. This implies that organizations must implement internal man - agement system changes to adapt to turbulence and foster new ideas among employees. Numerous researchers have explored the interplay between absorp - tive capacity and intellectual capital from a knowledge-based view. This perspective relates to knowledge transfer — such as team members acquiring and sharing external knowledge within the organization — - which affects organizational innovativeness [ 55, 60, 85 ]. From the standpoint of organizational learning, “ organizational learning ” en - compasses the methods by which organizations gather, generate, and disseminate knowledge to enhance performance and respond to evolving environments. It involves the acquisition, interpretation, and integration of new knowledge, as well as the modification of existing knowledge structures [ 27 ]. Studies from this perspective explore absorptive capacity concerning commitment-based human resources practices, organizational structures and routines, and knowledge crea - tion in ambidextrous organizations [ 13, 71 ]. From the network view, researchers focus on the social aspects of learning and innovation, particularly how social integration mecha - nisms — such as job rotation, participation in decision-making, team meetings, short-term visits, mobilities, and training — influence a net - work ’ s ability to acquire and utilize new knowledge [ 10, 46 ].

The behavioral and cognitive views emphasize individual-level characteristics — such as abilities and motivations to absorb knowl - edge — which play a crucial role in a firm ’ s absorptive capacity [ 17, 86 ]. Findings in this area suggest that both organizational and individual characteristics impact creative work behavior, both directly and indirectly. Finally, Table 2 presents the division of dominant theoretical un - derpinnings and their subtopics to outline the intellectual structure of the domain ’ s intersection. Additionally, Table 2 highlights exemplary references for each theoretical perspective as a summary of the above sections. 4.3. Research themes through antecedents – drivers – output framework In addition to the theoretical approaches identified in the full sam - ple, this review employed targeted analysis of empirical papers to develop an Antecedents-Drivers-Outcome (ADO) framework [ 39, 103 ]. Based on empirical evidence from a restricted sample of 88 empirical manuscripts, in this section, we present and discuss the main research topics integrated through the ADO framework (see Fig. 6 ). The devel - opment of the ADO framework follows the causal focus. As Ciuchta et al. [ 103 ] mention, the causal focus approach is a preference among scholars and is not inherently superior to other organizational methods. While this grouping might suggest that these studies focus exclusively on in - puts, processes, or outcomes - and may impose a structure that does not fully align with how the original authors view their work - the aim is to present the main research topics and their interrelations transparently (see Fig. 6 ). 4.3.1. Antecedents Inputs or antecedents refer to factors that precede a specific action. Earlier research has identified many inputs that alter internal organi - zational dynamics, which can lead to innovation. From our review, these antecedents can be divided into five major research groups: knowledge dynamics, organizational culture, organizational development pro - cesses, networking and social capital, and human capital empowerment. 4.3.1.1. Knowledge dynamics. Altering knowledge dynamics and fostering an organizational culture that values openness, learning, and experimentation with novel ideas are paramount. Herrmann, Gassmann, and Eisert [ 101 ] underscored the importance of such a culture in enabling the creation of absorptive capacity for radical innovations. B. Malisi ´c et al.

{"page_content": "Pihlajamaa [ 102 ] further elucidated that robust knowledge documen - tation and storage mechanisms safeguard existing knowledge and facilitate its transformation and application, enhancing knowledge creation and expanding a firm ’ s cognitive capacity to innovate. As Alavi and Leidner [ 104 ] noted, knowledge management involves comprehensive processes that identify and leverage an organization ’ s collective knowledge across activities such as creation, storage, transfer, sharing, and application. This process is integral to innovation, serving as a precursor to enhanced innovation performance by fostering the development and exchange of new ideas [ 99, 105 ]. Nowacki and Bach - nik [ 106 ] and Lee and Suh (2003) emphasize the strategic establishment of infrastructures that support implementing new ideas. These in - frastructures ensure the functional application of accumulated data and the preservation of invaluable tacit knowledge, even after employee departure [ 107 ]. Hence, knowledge management is a core organiza - tional strategy that leverages internal and external knowledge sources to spur innovation and performance. Furthermore, Davenport and Prusak [ 108 ] emphasize that knowl - edge sharing is essential and necessitates the presence of knowledgeable individuals within an organization to enhance its knowledge base. This process demands additional support from organizational coordination mechanisms and continuous human capital allocation and reallocation. Consequently, incorporating these elements within the framework of knowledge dynamics constitutes critical antecedents in our model. By improving innovativeness and absorptive capacity through strategic human resource practices, organizations are better equipped to succeed in dynamic environments. 4.3.1.2. Organizational culture. A literature review highlights the crucial impact of organizational culture and coordination on improving knowledge transfer, a process significantly shaped by human resources practices. Cohen and Levinthal [ 11 ] elaborated that a firm ’ s absorptive capacity hinges on individual abilities and organizational competence to foster knowledge exchange across various levels. This structured ex - change is critical for nurturing a firm ’ s expertise in knowledge man - agement and innovation [ 109, 110 ]. Empirical research by Demirkan [ 84 ] establishes a positive relationship between increased investment in employee training and enhanced product innovation capabilities within small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in Germany. The study found the following: (1) industries with a higher proportion of university-educated employees demonstrate a weaker correlation be - tween employee training and innovation capabilities; (2) the impact of training investments is less significant in larger SMEs compared to smaller ones; and (3) ongoing research and development activities reduce the effect of training expenditure on innovation capabilities. These findings contribute to the ongoing discussion about the necessity of employee training by affirming its importance while also highlighting the variable effects of such investments across different sizes of orga - nizations under specific conditions. Furthermore, employee training is recognized as a component of high-performance work systems that significantly enhance goal achievement in startups and SMEs [ 111 ]. Aligning with previous research, Hatch and Dyer [ 112 ] and Beugelsdijk [ 113 ] underscore the crucial role of employee training as an essential mechanism for devel - oping the knowledge and skills vital for new product development. Sung and Choi [ 3 ] argued that organizational investments in training and development foster a learning-oriented environment, facilitating knowledge and idea exchanges among employees and enhancing knowledge creation and innovation. Moreover, although sometimes underestimated by SME managers, employee training as an integral part of total quality management is positively associated with non-financial performance outcomes, including innovation and growth [ 114 ]. Consequently, this paper advocates for strategic investment in employee training to further develop employee skills and bolster product inno - vation capabilities in SMEs. Addressing the nuances of language in multinational contexts, Pel - tokorpi [ 115 ] highlighted the significance of language-sensitive recruitment and training in enhancing inter-unit knowledge transfer and bolstering a subsidiary ’ s absorptive capacity. Such practices bridge language barriers and facilitate a more profound integration of knowl - edge across cultural divides, enhancing global coordination and inno - vation capabilities (Lester, 1994; [ 84, 116 ]). Our review shows that organizational structures and practices are key components in the ADO model, summarizing the crucial elements that build a firm ’ s capabilities. By developing these elements, organizations can drive innovation and gain a strong competitive position globally. 4.3.1.3. Organizational development processes. Our review revealed that this input is structured into two critical and interrelated components: combinative capabilities and research and development activities. Together, these elements form a synergistic input that enhances a firm ’ s absorptive capacity and innovation outcomes. Combinative capabilities are fundamental to strategic innovation, encapsulating a firm ’ s ability to systematize, coordinate, and socialize knowledge. These capabilities enable organizations to integrate existing knowledge with new insights, fostering an environment where learning and innovation can thrive.

These capabilities enable organizations to integrate existing knowledge with new insights, fostering an environment where learning and innovation can thrive. As Santoro and Usai [ 117 ] pointed out, combinative capabilities facilitate a balance between knowledge acquisition, exploration, and exploita - tion — processes essential for innovation management. Robles (2016) highlighted the critical role of these capabilities in empowering em - ployees to manage their environments effectively and achieve organi - zational goals. Similarly, Gebauer et al. [ 50 ] and Zollo and Winter [ 70 ] emphasized that adapting these capabilities is vital for successful strategic innova - tion. They argued that understanding the interaction between learning processes and combinative capabilities can explain differential competitive advantages among firms in similar contexts, suggesting a profound influence on converting external knowledge into strategic in - novations. Author Gebauer [ 50 ], using multiple case study of two electricity providers, explored positive socialization effects of learning processes and absorptive capacity on product and process innovation. Complementing combinative capabilities, research and development (R & D) activities play a dual role in building absorptive capacity and generating new knowledge and innovations. R & D efforts serve as a Table 2 Exemplary references regarding theoretical cornerstones.

{"page_content": "channel for acquiring and integrating external knowledge within the firm ’ s existing knowledge base. Schmidt [ 85 ] elaborated that while R & D intensity may not directly influence the absorptive capacity for intra- and inter-industry knowledge, integrating R & D with skilled labor and knowledge management tools is crucial for effectively exploiting external knowledge. Ghebrihiwet [ 118 ] and Martínez-S ´anchez [ 119 ] highlighted that continuous investment in R & D significantly enhances the likelihood of introducing new and imitative innovations, while human resources practices related to R & D efforts positively influence innovation performance. Roy [ 9 ] adds that cooperative R & D, supported by effective human resource practices, strongly facilitates incremental and new-to-market innovations. By synchronizing combinative capabilities with R & D activities, firms can implement various strategies to improve their absorptive capacities and innovation outcomes. Combinative capabilities ensure that the knowledge generated through R & D is effectively integrated and utilized across the organization. This interaction supports the development of new products and processes and improves the firm ’ s strategic behaviors and efficiency in the competitive landscape. Such an approach to innovation and development is important for firms aspiring to maintain and enhance their market position through continuous improvement and strategic innovation. 4.3.1.4. Networking & social capital input. Networking and Social Cap - ital are vital for fostering an environment conducive to innovation, encompassing three critical areas: External and Internal Networks, Team Behavior, and Leadership. To begin with, strategically configuring both external and internal networks enhances knowledge acquisition and appropriation [ 46 ]. These networks enable seamless knowledge flow and integration, fostering continuous innovation and improvement. Next, team dynamics significantly impact an organization ’ s absorptive capacity - the ability to assimilate and apply new knowledge [ 11 ]. For example, positive team behaviors are linked to innovative outcomes [ 120 ], while negative interactions can hinder performance and morale [ 121 – 123 ]. Equally important, effective leadership is paramount in promoting knowledge sharing and innovation. In particular, supportive leadership enhances performance by encouraging knowledge-sharing behaviors [ 124 ]. Thus, empowering and transformational leadership styles stimulate participation in innovation processes [ 125, 126 ]. Next, training managers in participative leadership further improve recep - tiveness to employee ideas [ 69 ]. Collectively, well-structured networks, positive team dynamics, and strong leadership enhance an organiza - tion ’ s innovative capabilities explored within Taiwan ’ s high, medium, and low-technology firms [ 69 ]. Integrating these elements into strategic human resource practices positions organizations to thrive in dynamic environments. 4.3.1.5. Human capital empowerment. Empowering employees and enhancing their ability to innovate and embrace an innovative culture are critical inputs, encompassing performance management systems (PMSs) and human capital development. PMSs enhance employees ’ capacity to assess organizational activities within their context, enabling decisions that optimize the firm ’ s long-term performance ([ 127, 128 ], 2000). Studies have explored the effects of PMS design on organizational outcomes, including capability development [ 129 ], effectiveness [ 130 ], innovativeness [ 55 ], and performance [ 131, 132 ]. Although some conceptualize PMSs as singular practices, numerous design decisions contribute to their construction, each potentially having different im - pacts (Homburg et al., 2012). Earlier studies concentrate on specific performance measurement system (PMS) characteristics [ 133, 134 ]. PMSs are formal information collection tools that promote organiza - tional learning [ 129 ]. Previous research underscores the importance of environmental factors in shaping the impact of PMSs [ 93,135,136 ] and in affecting the precursors and consequences of absorptive capacity ([ 14, 137 ]; Roberts, 2015). Bedford et al. [ 55 ] argue that environmental dynamism moderates the connection between PMS design choices and potential absorptive capacity within this framework. Organizations adopting a commitment-based HR approach view human resource practices as long-term investments in employees [ 138 ]. This aligns with a knowledge-based employment model, where human capital is considered a crucial strategic asset. Consequently, human resource practices focus on acquiring and enhancing employee skills and competencies (Lepak & Snell, 2002). This underscores the importance of knowledge-based employment models and performance measurement design systems — such as the scope and integration of performance measures — in highly dynamic situations. These systems enable members to obtain relevant metrics from external information recognized through scanning and evaluation systems. By optimizing these elements, firms can improve internal processes and enhance their competitive position through better knowledge management and innovation outcomes. In particular, our review highlights performance-driven incentives, flexible training schedules, and learning activities, alongside strategic recruit - ment and selection, as key factors in promoting knowledge acquisition and innovation. 4.3.2.

Drivers Our review has identified factors that can facilitate, and challenge innovations driven by human resource practices. Specifically, we have identified notable moderators or drivers and clustered them into cate - gories linked to absorptive capacity, specific human resource practices, innovation and learning processes, and networking and social processes. Absorptive capacity is vital for empowering workers and boosting an organization ’ s innovation capabilities. It refers to the ability to recog - nize the significance of new knowledge, assimilate it, and apply it to specific issues [ 72 ]. Peltokorpi [ 115 ] describes absorptive capacity as the ability of employees in overseas subsidiaries to absorb added in - formation from the internal sources of multinational firms. Schmidt [ 85 ] also refers to it as a company ’ s capacity to detect, integrate, and leverage knowledge from its surroundings. Additionally, Lopez and Esteves [ 46 ] discuss the significance of internal and external networks in knowledge acquisition. These insights highlight the importance of prior knowledge when utilizing the latest information for business objectives. Enhancing a company ’ s dynamic innovation capabilities can improve its absorptive capacity, enabling the identification of new knowledge and the devel - opment of innovative technologies. Innovation and learning processes, as drivers within the antecedents- drivers-outcomes (ADO) framework, stress the role of knowledge, creativity, competence, experience, skills, training, and attitude in building human capital within businesses. Blundell et al. [ 139 ] and Lenihan et al. [ 140 ] identify education as crucial in improving employee competency. Furthermore, Malisic and Tinaj [ 141 ] stressed that creating educational and training lifelong learning programs for SME employees is crucial for developing employees ’ competencies, such as innovative - ness and creativity, which foster an innovative environment and firm performance. Scholars such as Cummings and O ’ Connell [ 142 ], Sultana and Rahman [ 143 ], and Holtzhausen and Botha (2019) consider inno - vative leadership to be a crucial driver of organizational success and innovation. They define creative leadership as combining diverse lead - ership styles to motivate people to develop innovative ideas, products, and services, cultivating a culture of innovation and trust within enterprises. Open innovation is a collaborative approach involving relationships with external groups to enhance research, development, and innovation. Matsuzaki et al. [ 144 ] emphasize the importance of collaboration with universities, public research institutions, and other enterprises as critical components of open innovation. What ’ s more, Liu et al. (2022a) and Zhang et al. [ 145 ] define knowledge management as an organizational strategy aimed at acquiring, developing, and utilizing knowledge to support employee performance and improve organizational learning capacities. All these components describe the relationship between knowledge-oriented leadership, organizational learning capabilities, B. Malisi ´c et al.

Networking and social processes play a crucial role in innovation domain. West et al. [ 146 ] suggest that organizations with a diverse human capital pool have an advantage in open innovation, as they can leverage existing diversity rather than create it by hiring fresh staff. Open innovation is commonly understood as the inflow or outflow of knowledge across organizational borders, emphasizing the inflow component — using external knowledge sources to expedite the innova - tion process. Social networking and social processes collectively un - derline the importance of well-structured networks, positive team dynamics, and strong leadership in enhancing organizations ’ innovative capabilities. By optimizing these elements, firms can improve their in - ternal processes and strengthen their competitive market position through better knowledge management and innovation outcomes. 4.3.3. Output Various literature sources illustrate the complex nature of innovation and its connection to internal dynamics. Our analysis identified several outcomes of altering internal dynamics and empowering human resource practices, enabling us to recognize organizational changes linked to the enhancement of different types of innovation — open, organizational, process, product, technological, and radical — as well as absorptive capacity. Understanding these connections is essential for organizations aiming to enhance their innovative capabilities. Developing innovative and useful ideas for services, products, pro - cedures, and processes [ 147 ] relies on assessing, integrating, and applying new knowledge [ 11 ]. In this context, adopting human resource practices that link organizational culture behavior with outcomes is imperative, particularly in achieving innovation. Innovation requires \"without a box\" thinking and merging often unrelated knowledge into new concepts. Zhang et al. [ 148 ] suggest that creativity and innovation arise from team interactions; thus, fostering effective team dynamics is critical for the success of innovation. Wright and Snell [ 149 ] emphasize the necessity of empowering human resources with flexibility regarding resource and coordination capabilities, including the extent to which an organization possesses various skills and how quickly they can be acti - vated, underscoring the importance of adaptability in human resources and organizational processes. Park et al. [ 92 ] portray human resource practices as necessary for technology innovation, encompassing component and combinative skills within human resource management systems. Moderating human resource practices — such as training programs, recruitment strategies, and fostering a high-performance work culture — addresses the rela - tionship between human resource flexibility and absorptive ability. These practices highlight how businesses can leverage internal and external information to gain competitive advantage and enhance inno - vativeness. By investing in these areas, organizations can build a skilled and adaptable workforce capable of driving innovation forward. Chesbrough [ 150 ] portrays open innovation as accelerating inno - vation through blurring organizational borders and embracing external sources. Several scholars, including Lavie and Rosenkopf [ 51 ], Cheng and Chen [ 52 ], and Beck and Schenker-Wicki [ 53 ], acknowledge the role of external sources and emphasize the significance of dynamic innovation capabilities and absorptive capacity in fostering break - through innovations and enhancing innovation performance. Similarly, Bogers et al. [ 16 ] examine how diversity within firms can facilitate openness to external knowledge sources, contributing to open innova - tion efforts. Papa et al. [ 151 ] underscore the role of HRM in shaping the relationship between the firm and its employees and developing tech - nology through open innovation techniques. These studies collectively highlight the critical role that external knowledge and partnerships play in the innovation process. As depicted in Fig. 5, the networking view is often associated with technological and open innovation research, particularly regarding how it affects a firm ’ s ties and overall degree of openness and performance. Lopez and Estevez [ 46 ] explore external and internal networks as the main resources for gaining new knowledge and supporting technological and open innovations. Their study includes research on new Web 2.0 applications and a new management paradigm of knowledge storage to accelerate the processing of large datasets, enabling organizations to scale their hiring processes swiftly to meet dynamic market demands. Organizations must adopt new technologies and networking to remain innovative. The literature review and MCA analysis indicate that the resource- based view is often combined with the absorptive capacity and behav - ioral and cognitive views to understand human resource practices and their impact on innovation. Our review demonstrates that organiza - tional innovation is closely associated with a knowledge-based view, suggesting that the knowledge-based view, intellectual capital view, and absorptive capacity are essential for understanding the relationship between internal dynamics and innovation. This association can be explained by the significant influence of knowledge-based dynamic ca - pabilities, indicating that employees must develop norms and routines to support external knowledge absorption.

Future research and implications Innovation is necessary for organizational competitiveness and per - formance in a rapidly evolving technological landscape. Recognizing the relevance of organizational capabilities, the critical role of the envi - ronment within an organization, and the pivotal contribution of human resources in value creation, our review reveals the current state of research and what gaps or future research opportunities exist in this domain. In light of the MCA analysis results, we have developed Fig. 7 to serve as a guideline for formulating future research agenda. It identifies key topics and theoretical foundations that form the basis of the domain ’ s intersections and those that are emerging or currently under-explored. Specifically, Fig. 7 illustrates the frequency of each topic and theoret - ical foundation, depicting their relative distance from the central interplay of the domain [ 44 ]. This approach categorizes topics into distinct quadrants: well-researched topics in the top-left quadrant, emerging topics in the bottom-left quadrant, and under-researched topics in the bottom-right quadrant. Coordinates derived for Fig. 5 were used to calculate distances between each theoretical perspective and major research topic relative to the center of the map. Fig. 7 visu - alizes these outcomes, dividing the map into quadrants. The top-left quadrant represents well-researched topics characterized by high fre - quency and proximity to the center, indicating they are fundamental to the field of research. Although these topics are foundational, future studies should assess their continued relevance critically. The bottom-left quadrant highlights emerging topics, reflecting areas of increasing scholarly interest and identifying potential gaps in literature that require further investigation. The bottom-right quadrant identifies pertinent gaps, emphasizing under-researched topics that offer signifi - cant opportunities for future study. This approach is acknowledged for its efficacy in identifying and visualizing areas with varying degrees of research attention (see examples in Ref. [ 45, 152 ]), thus providing a compelling framework for future research development. Traditional human resource management approaches aim to align firm internal dynamics with business strategy, leveraging knowledge, connections, and organizational resources to transform and innovate existing norms and approaches.

{"page_content": "continuous scholarly emphasis on conducting research built upon the tenets of theoretical views such as resource-based, knowledge-based, and dynamic view perspectives, while there is a lack of study around topics of process and radical innovation (see Fig. 7 ). Consequently, our review concurs with Aliasghar et al. [ 153 ] notion that process innovation is relatively underexplored, which is surprising considering that complementary to product innovation, process inno - vation is one of the methods organizations use to create value through internal and external integration. Recognizing that knowledge sharing and social cohesion are crucial for innovation, our review identifies that studying the relevance of the working atmosphere or organizational culture and its influence on knowledge transfer and potential informa - tion asymmetry caused by knowledge hiding represents promising research avenues. Acknowledging behavioral and cognitive perspectives as emerging theoretical foundations for understanding the interaction between human resource practices, absorptive capacity, and innovation raises questions about the influence of traits such as a strong need for power or a high propensity for risk-taking. To what extent do these traits genu - inely drive innovation? When considering cognition, it asks which as - pects are most pertinent. Should the emphasis be on decision-making processes, such as those identified by Kahneman ’ s (2011) System 1 and System 2, in relation to innovation? It could be argued that human resource practices that balance intuitive and analytical decision-making modes might give firms a dual advantage in fostering a responsive yet informed approach to innovation. Some perspectives suggest that intu - itive decision-making, which relies on simplified heuristics and fast re - sponses, might support rapid adaptation and absorptive capacity in dynamic markets. Conversely, analytical decision-making could enable a deeper, more deliberate integration of complex information, poten - tially enhancing the quality of innovative outcomes. Another important aspect is the relationship between a firm ’ s in - ternal dynamics, specifically its diversity, equality, and inclusion practices, and its absorptive capacity, which is critical in promoting innovation. Research suggests that diverse teams bring varied experi - ences and viewpoints, which can lead to more creative problem-solving and innovation. The interactions among individuals from different backgrounds can generate new ideas, facilitate effective feedback, and improve the integration of mechanisms within organizations. Under - standing how diversity, equity, and inclusion influence the relationship between human resource practices, absorptive capacity, and innovation is essential for developing more inclusive organizational strategies that promote creativity and performance. In particular, our literature review aligns with Wang and Chen ’ s [ 29 ] systems approach, linking a high-performance work system of HR practices (e.g., staffing, training, skill-based rewards, and team devel - opment) with intellectual capital, emphasizing development and inno - vation. In this context, future research can significantly contribute by illustrating promotion focus and prevention focus practices. Researchers could explore how various formal incentives, motivations, and feedback related to the regulatory focus can encourage competitiveness and innovativeness. Above all, an important research gap concerns employee voice empowerment, employee motivation, and its effects on transitioning from potential to realized innovation, which may be negative when long-term benefits and incentives are diminished. Conversely, hiring temporary workers or embracing a hybrid modus operandi can introduce fresh ideas to companies and inspire full-time employees, fostering the development of new process solutions (e.g., reducing development times and improving quality and reliability). To capture these effects and recognize noticeable improvements in pro - duction processes, future research may benefit from digging deeper into the role of prior research and development experience and the invest - ment in workers ’ skills, particularly across various levels and sizes of departments or organizations.

{"page_content": "promising research directions. This line of research might examine how human resource practices impact the ability of these companies to capitalize on opportunities through collaboration with various external organizations, including suppliers, customers, universities, public research institutes, and commercial R & D laboratories from different regions. Accordingly, the breadth of human capital, encompassing both cognitive and non-cognitive dimensions, directly influences the devel - opment of sustainable competitive advantages and organizational innovation. As such, this research line could encompass specific skills acquired through professional international experience and the role of personal traits such as motivation, personality, and values in enhancing radical innovation. Next, given that radical innovations entail higher risks and call for strategic reward incentives like career advancements (e.g., moving from junior to senior positions), analyzing human resource practices individually or as part of cohesive bundles is essential. Considering that human resource practices affect performance-related outcomes [ 154 ], the strategic integration of performance measure - ment systems represents crucial mechanisms that influence organiza - tions ’ innovative capabilities and absorptive capacity. For example, authors von Briel et al. [ 10 ] explored the role of social integration mechanisms on radical innovation focusing on knowledge distance. Knowledge distance is the distance between external knowledge and internal knowledge within firms. This study explored the importance of absorption of knowledge distance on radical innovation – the intersec - tion of the absorptive capacity and innovation. Despite its significance, research on radical innovation remains scarce. Our review recognizes this gap and proposes the following questions: How do specific human resource practices influence and support radical innovation? In what ways do team social networks shape radical innovation outcomes? How can team creativity drive and sustain radical innovation? How do knowledge transfer processes between teams and their partners enhance radical innovation, particularly when mediated by organizational stra - tegies and culture? Embracing research on network density, two-way interactions that help the interpretation and understanding of new external knowledge, alongside the role of supportive cross-departmental relationships, rep - resents a promising research avenue. Especially considering that Geba - uer et al. [ 50 ] highlighted how information socialization affects all four learning processes (exploratory, assimilative, transformative, and exploitative). Therefore, future research can significantly contribute by illustrating the practices and impacts of companies that urgently need to manage the accumulation of external knowledge. It is essential for these companies to enhance their combinative capabilities — such as system - atization, coordination, and socialization of knowledge — and to ease information overload in order to succeed in innovation. Further explo - ration of the capabilities essential for radical and process innovation should include a comprehensive analysis of individual, team, organi - zational, and inter-organizational dimensions, with particular attention to the characteristics of knowledge distance. Next, exploring how the learning perspective enhances process, and radical innovation would be useful, seeing as firms ’ capability to absorb, assimilate, and transform new external knowledge. This involves continuous perception of the environment (e.g., market changes, tech - nology trends) and appropriate reaction to changes (e.g., new strategies or improved business processes). Furthermore, exploring the relation - ship between learning processes and innovation outcomes would be useful, including network and intellectual capital views as the evolution of learning processes and combinative capabilities. Future research could examine the convergence of absorptive capacity and network perspectives because the concept of absorptive infrastructure is vital for effectively assimilating and utilizing new knowledge. The importance of internal and external networks in knowledge acquisition significantly influences learning process evolution and combinative capabilities, which drive innovation. In an era of ever-expanding sources of information, further to research gaps identified in Fig. 7., several topics linked to artificial intelligence (AI) emerge, focusing on how AI affects work practices, creates new interaction paradigms, and transforms organizational pro - cesses. In recent years, AI-driven tools have emerged as viable solutions to address challenges in employment and recruitment, offering scal - ability, efficiency, and the potential to reduce biases [ 155 ]. For instance, companies such as Sapia and Pymetrics have pioneered the use of AI in recruitment by implementing Natural Language Processing (NLP) models to infer personality traits from text and interviews (Dai et al., 2022). However, despite the promise shown by AI systems, their psy - chometric properties — such as reliability, validity, resistance to social desirability, and their impact on firm innovativeness — remain under-explored in academic literature and warrant further research. The rapid adoption of AI in recruitment processes has significantly trans - formed how organizations identify, assess, and select candidates. For example, traditional psychometric tests, long considered the gold stan - dard in predicting job performance, have demonstrated robust validity and reliability over decades (Schmidt & Hunter, 1998). We recommend that researchers investigate how integrating artificial intelligence en - hances organizational capabilities, particularly in maintaining a competitive edge through effective and adaptable recruitment pro - cesses.

Furthermore, it is essential to thoroughly examine how AI will in - fluence various aspects of employee roles, including redundancy, replacement, displacement, and the creation of new opportunities. This includes evaluating the evolving skills requirements, the impact on job meaningfulness, workforce relationships and dynamics, job satisfaction, and innovativeness. Additionally, as companies harness AI ’ s innovative potential, future research should investigate the associated risks and uncertainties due to its rapid development, as well as the potential for misuse. 5.1. Managerial implications Human capital represents a multifaceted asset integral to innovation. Empowerment of human capital and pursuit of innovation and innova - tiveness depends upon elements of an ’ innovation supportive ’ work - place, such as encouragement of risk-taking, freedom and autonomy, facilitation of collaboration, and provision of resources and support. Our review has shown that in organizations where team members ’ knowl - edge, suggestions, and opinions are vital for operations, managers need to focus on encouraging knowledge sharing positively. This approach can boost team members ’ ability to absorb new information and foster knowledge integration to generate innovative ideas. Additionally, or - ganizations should offer training programs to educate managers on effectively encouraging knowledge sharing. We outline antecedents and drivers of innovation and absorptive capacity through the ADO frame - work. One particular notion that stands out from our review is the recognition of human resource professionals and the necessity for their proactive approach in creating, diffusing, and stabilizing changes, as employees are often convulsed due to organizational policy changes and practices that diminish trust, support, and respect. Therefore, we concur with Chowdhury et al. (2023) recognition of decision-makers ’ relevance in deploying resources to inspiring innovation-oriented organizations and making a difference, as this is likely to depend on internal organi - zational dynamics. Equally important in today ’ s era of technological advancements is the significance of performance measurement systems (PMS) as essential precursors to innovation. Our review highlights several scholars, including Lill et al. (2020) and Bedford et al. [ 55 ], who have demon - strated the crucial role that PMSs play in enhancing an organization ’ s absorptive capacity - the capability to comprehend, assimilate, and utilize external knowledge. For example, Bedford et al. [ 55 ] suggest that B. Malisi ´c et al.

{"page_content": "a broad-scope PMS correlates with a higher potential absorptive ca - pacity in dynamic environments, enhancing the organization ’ s ability to effectively acquire and assimilate external knowledge. Conversely, higher integration within PMSs may dampen this potential in such en - vironments, though both broad scope and integration positively influ - ence the realized absorptive capacity. This realized capacity pertains to the transformation and exploitation of acquired knowledge, which is crucial for sustaining competitive advantage and fostering innovation. These insights illuminate the nuanced impact of performance manage - ment and system design on a firm ’ s innovative processes and outcomes. Companies can better harness their innovative potential and adapt more effectively to changing market conditions by strategically aligning in - ternal dynamics with organizational goals and environmental demands. This strategic alignment is critical in a context characterized by rapid technological changes and intense competition, where practical knowledge and innovation management are critical to success. 6. Conclusion Given the significant relevance of internal dynamics on innovation and their impact on organizational competitiveness, the topic of human resource management practices combined with absorptive capacity has attracted considerable interest among academics and practitioners. The increase in scholarly research since 2018 highlights the continuous ef - forts of scholars, managers, administrators, and policymakers to empower HRM and enhance absorptive capacity and innovation. By recognizing the key intersections within this domain and emerging or under-explored topics, our review adds value by highlighting existing connections and identifying gaps at these intersections. Specifically, the review provides a blueprint for further development in this field through recommendations and proposed avenues for future research that link unexplored topics — such as the network perspective, learning approach, intellectual capital, and various innovation types and methods. As with many other reviews, this manuscript has certain limitations. First, our analysis excluded proceedings, conference papers, books, and grey literature. While most reviews primarily focus on peer-reviewed manuscripts, we acknowledge that relevant practices and novel ap - proaches may exist in sources beyond our scope, which could have influenced the ADO framework and the outcomes of the MCA analysis. Additionally, recognizing that collecting and synthesizing manuscripts from various sources may introduce some author biases due to inherent subjectivity, we believe future reviews can build upon our work by extending beyond the intersection of the three domains and examining internal dynamics, such as innovative organizations or tangentially related areas like organizational resilience, digital transformation, or technological readiness. Similarly, we acknowledge a limitation related to the content analysis and execution of the hybrid approach, which, like search query development and data selection, may reflect some author biases. Despite these limitations, our study proposes several directions that we hope will inspire future research and draw further attention to this timely topic from both scientific and societal perspectives.

Introduction Strategic Management Accounting (SMA), a forward-looking approach to management accounting, has received acknowledgement for promoting the accomplishment of long-term management goals through gathering and analyzing of competitive information relating to cost, markets and organizational strategies. SMA refers to the amal - gamation of the required financial and non financial information to be informed and further used to take strategic decisions in businesses. It clearly focuses on the long run capability and success of the firm by analyzing competitive intelligence patterns regarding cost structures together with market dynamics. Based on ( Alsharari, 2024; Namazi & Rezaei, 2024 ), SMA ’ s focus on the external environment and strategic configuration enables it to position itself as a valuable tool for attaining competitive advantage (CA). CA is the upper edge or a better foot that a business or firm has over its competitors, this further enables higher sales and profits and customer loyalty than its competitors. The orga - nization reaches competitive advantage through distinct resources ability and unique strategies that create valuable positioning within its market framework. Hence SMA, which combines both qualitative and quantitative data, helps organizations to predict the market direction in line with available resources and uniqueness of services rendered. * Corresponding author.

{"page_content": "However, its contribution to CA depends on contextual factors and has not been well established especially in changing environments like financial services sector. Cybersecurity (CS) refers to the measures taken to protect an orga - nization ’ s IT assets, such as networks, data and computer systems against internet attacks that could interrupt business operations or compromise, destroy, or modify important information ( ¨ Ozsungur, 2021 ). CS necessitates the integration of individuals, procedures, and technological tools for safeguarding businesses, persons, or networks from cyberattacks ( Almomani et al., 2021 ). While enhancing CS, the Digital Transformation (DT) perspective must be included, because DT has become a strategic approach for achieving a CA in today ’ s digital economy ( Guthrie et al., 2019; Matarazzo et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2024; Zhuo & Chen, 2023 ), being a method for digitalizing established plat - forms ( Arnaboldi et al., 2017; Bresciani et al., 2018; Verhoef et al., 2021 ). DT is the whole process and flow of navigating and leveraging technology, mainly digital technology to achieve fundamental opera - tional and customer value delivery transformations. It encompasses digital technology integration into every sector and experience major improvements across operational efficiency and customer experiences and business model patterns. This research seeks to establish relationship between SMA and CA incorporating the mediating roles of CS and DT. As the business envi - ronment continues to intensify over recent years mainly due to the in - fluence of technology, globalization and increased customer demands, the competition that organizations experience has increased drastically. Changes have escalated to the extent that the concept of strategic management practices has emerged that not only simply attends to market needs, but also averts future threats. In this respect, SMA remains a key intermediary as financial information feeds into the organizational strategic decision-making processes. Compared to conventional man - agement accounting, SMA involves external factors related to the posi - tion of a business, its competitors and the industry in which the business operates. This allows the firms to form a strategic fit between their re - sources and environmental demands, ultimately fostering sustainable competitive advantage. However, SMA has been seen to be highly effective in driving the CA and this effectiveness is subject to a number of external and internal factors. Lack of conformity of SMA to the demands of DT and threats of CS may make it hard for some organizations to optimize on this strategic point. For example, innovation and technically advanced knowledge and features are complementary to the SMA concept that focuses more on the outside environment and market trends. In contrast, ignoring these aspects could lead to risks affecting firms, especially in areas that are experiencing technological dynamism such as financial services industry. 1.1. Practical and social relevance The growing importance of SMA in tackling today ’ s issues is high - lighted by recent industry publications. In the McKinsey Technology Trends Outlook (2022) report, McKinsey underlines the importance of digital technologies as tools for improving and changing operation models, as well as the role they play in providing customers satisfaction. Also, Ernst & Young (EY) in their EY Value Realized (2023) report on Global impact, reveal the growing risk of cyberattacks that would destabilize operations and erode stakeholder trust. These realizations prove that organizations cannot underestimate the role of CS when it comes to global protection of digital resources and maintaining business operations. Altogether, these insights raise awareness of the need for defining a concise relationship between SMA and CA, with overcoming CS and implementing DT as necessary enabler at their intersection. Meeting this need can give organizations a tactical framework to suc - cessfully operate in a more challenging environment. 1.2. Research problem, gaps and motivation The fundamental role of Strategic Management Accounting (SMA) in developing Competitive Advantage (CA) remains acknowledged but the current research lacks sufficient investigation of this process particularly within highly digitizing sectors such as financial services. The existing body of research focuses mainly on theoretical investigations of SMA without examining its internal implementation as digital changes take shape (Gomez Conde, 2015; Hyvonen, 2005). Furthermore, in the past works, the role of Cyber Security (CS) and Digital Transformation (DT) as relationship mediators between SMAs and Cas has been overlooked besides their substantial influence on organization adaptation and resilience. Moreover, researches in the past confirms that Cyber Security functions as a vital factor which drives organizational success together with reputation and customer trust ( Smith et al., 2010 ). DT produces value by helping businesses improve their organizational capital with innovative processes that boost their overall growth ( Matarazzo et al., 2021; Verhoef et al., 2021 ) simultaneously. The current research analyzes highlights a few important gaps spe - cifically relevant to the financial services industry.

The current research analyzes highlights a few important gaps spe - cifically relevant to the financial services industry. Research reveals that in spite of well-established role of SMA ’ s in sustaining CA the past re - searches provide little evidence about how SMA helps industries improve their competitive power by embracing DT. The existing research body has revealed significant gaps in understanding the dy - namic relationship between SMA and its interactions with CS and DT which determine CA, resulting in the need of deeper mediation studies. Literature presents conflicting results in findings about the impact of SMA adoption on organizational competitiveness because multiple studies find positive outcomes alongside findings of underperformance. The widespread use of conventional management accounting frame - works produces this inconsistency by missing essential strategic and long-term perspectives required for current fast-paced business envi - ronments. The strategic benefits of modern developments like big data analytics are sparsely studied together with SMA management ap - proaches. Through this research we build essential groundwork for future investigation to show the importance of studying SMA, CS and DT together as essential components of sustainable competitive perfor - mance within digital platforms. While prior theoretical research outlined how SMA provides value to strategy, no quantitative scientific literature researches its contingency with CA accompanied by CS and DT. This research work fulfills it by targeting the financial services industry in India; a subject that has attracted minimal research attention despite the sector ’ s global signifi - cance. The financial services sector poses specific constraints, including legal requirements, specific data protection needs, and evolving in an increasingly digital world, which situates the study of these dynamics appropriately. Specifically, the study aims to. • What is the relationship between SMA and CA in the Financial Ser - vices Sector of India? • How does CS mediate the relationship between SMA and CA? • In what ways does DT mediate and enhance the relationship between SMA and CA? 1.3. Contribution of the study This research examines the association between Strategic Manage - ment Accounting (SMA) and Competitive Advantage (CA) via analyzing the mediating role of Cyber Security (CS) and Digital Transformation (DT) in the financial services industry settings. This research initiative targets literature gaps to demonstrate SMA operations within fast- changing digitized landscapes requiring advanced security parameters. The proposed framework integrates cognitive constructs to show SMA functions strategically for acquiring CA yet recognizes CS and DT serve as critical relationship enablers.

{"page_content": "theoretical evaluation this research demonstrates the way organizations can overcome modern business obstacles by using strategic management approaches combined with strong security systems alongside active digital transformation initiatives. The research results deliver mean - ingful guidance for financial services practitioners who need expertise about digital competition within their sector. The study is organized in the following way: it begins with a comprehensive review of the literature on constructs such as SMA, CS, DT, and CA. The present study follows a structure that includes the formulation of hypotheses, the description of the methodology and re - sults, and an emphasis on the discussion, limitations, theoretical and practical consequences, in addition to potential areas for future avenues. 2. Theoritical background As a framework, Contingency Theory offers a robust lens through which the linkage between DT, CS and SMA can be viewed from. The key assumption of this theory is that the success of management practices depends on the alignment with the specific conditions of an organiza - tion ’ s internal and external environment. This alignment is particularly important in today ’ s digital environment, where the degree of tech - nology uptake and the requirement for secure IT protection may differ starkly across industry and organizational settings. Since the success of SMA implementation greatly depends on internal and external variables, we use contingency theory as an overarching theory in this study. Ac - cording to the contingency approach to management, the selection of a managerial strategy is dependent on the environmental factors that are in play, due to the varying factors present in the business environment ( McAdam et al., 2019 ). If applied to SMA, it means that SMA practices are contextual and will vary from firm to firm. Contingency theory pertains to the arrangement of systems for accounting. It assumes that the systems can be properly constructed to match the particular needs of the firm, encompassing its technology, organizational structure, and external competitive landscape (CIMA, 2005). There is no ideal design for an information system as an outcome of SMA practices ( Christen & Lovaas, 2022 ). The information generated by SMA practices and used may have any of these four fits – selection, interaction, systems, and mediating fit. What suits the firm depends on contextual variables, SMA practices, and performance outcomes ( McAdam et al., 2019 ). Scholars have used this theory to identify the factors influencing Traditional management accounting (TMA)/SMA practices ( Ahmad & Mohamed Zabri, 2015; Hadid & Al-Sayed, 2021; Oyewo, 2022; Oyewo et al., 2021; Talwar et al., 2021 ). TMA remains the standard method in which companies utilize historical facts alongside financial reports for business oversight. Through this approach business owners examine internal financial reports with limited strategic insights regarding external fac - tors affecting performance results. Contingency Theory provides a sound approach to describing the relations between DT, CS and SMA where goals, activities, and struc - tures may exist as optimal only under certain organizational and envi - ronmental conditions. SMA ’ s readiness in delivering as well as embracing the integration of DT depends on various factors such as in - dustry dynamics, technological maturity, and cybersecurity integration. For example, manufacturing companies prefer IoT for real-time costs to support manufacturing decisions, healthcare companies utilize big data analytics to improve the supply of resources and predictive decisions, and financial firms prefer IoT to assess risks and follow the compliance results. Technological infrastructure also features as another contin - gency with complex technology providing architectural integration of SMA capabilities, while underdeveloped technologies proving very problematic. CS then comes out prominently as an essential component given the increasing threat of data tampers, influencing decision making and avoiding organizational risks like financial frauds and non- compliance with set rules depending on the industry. Although the literature recognizes various contingencies that impact SMA effective - ness, a gap exists in understanding how DT and CS mediate and enable SMA effectiveness. Thus, this study adopting contingency frameworks provides a rich perspective of how the DT and CS interact to influence SMA practices. It stresses on achieving the strategic goals and objectives of SMA in rela - tion to the industry-specific dynamics and technology trends, along with the CS factors as important guidelines that can help the organizations to enhance the SMA strategic decision-making process.

It presents an integrated model that allows us to gain a comprehensive understanding of how the utilization of SMA leads to the creation of CA.

The figure depicts the elements used in the study and shows the relationships that were examined (see Fig. 1 ). 2.1. Literature review and hypothesis development 2.1.1. SMA and CA Management accounting is the use of business information for decision-making to achieve a firm ’ s objectives and improve operational efficiency ( Anders ´en & Samuelsson, 2016; Lavia & Hiebl, 2014 ). The SMA term was initially used by Simmonds (1982), who defined it as a gathering of proactive and outward-facing management accounting methodologies that examine information regarding a company and its competitors. They are also employed to formulate and oversee a busi - ness ’ s strategy. Scholars often provide differing definitions, and there is not a single agreed one ( Martins & de Campos Barros, 2021; Zeghal & Mhedhbi, 2006 ). According to CIMA (2005), SMA is a branch of man - agement accounting that focuses on gathering and analyzing data related to external issues and challenges faced by the firm, non-financial data, and internally generated data. Both Simmonds (1982) and CIMA (2005) agree on management accounting data and the usage of non-financial information management accounting provides in devel - oping and evaluating strategy. TMA techniques or practices, on the other hand, lack strategic orientation and are more focused on short-term and inward-oriented ( Ahmad & Mohamed Zabri, 2015; Cadez & Guilding, 2012; Hassan & Marston, 2019 ). SMA is more long-term and externally oriented, and if a management accounting practice has these charac - teristics, it should be classified as an SMA practice ( Cadez & Guilding, 2012 ). As TMA stresses short-term planning, costing, and decision-making, it will be difficult to apply to today ’ s complex manufacturing systems, which require flexibility, computer-integration, and optimization ( Oyewo, 2022 ). Considering the criteria mentioned above, a number of practices have been identified as SMA. Some of these techniques are associated with costing, including product life cycle costing, which estimates the product cost at different life stages. Then there is activity-based costing, target costing, competitor accounting, and customer accounting ( Baird et al., 2017; Bar-Yosef et al., 2019; Khlif et al., 2020; Langfield-Smith, 2008; Ng & Wood, 2018 ). The results of implementing these practices are not uniform, and scholars have identified various factors that affect a successful implementation ( Turner et al., 2017 ). Some of these contin - gency factors that scholars have identified include organizational structure, business strategy, IT and IS quality, market orientation (in - ternal), and external variables such as business environmental uncer - tainty and market competition ( Ahmad & Mohamed Zabri, 2015 ). Empirical results of these contingency factors are mixed in terms of implementation rate, strength, and statistical significance of impact (Cescon et al., 2019; Yazdifar et al., 2019; Turner et al., 2017; Cadez & Guilding, 2012 ). As SMA practices are more long-term, strategic, and market- oriented, their usage may create a sustainable CA ( Ditkaew, 2023 ). Though SMA practices are supposed to bring improved operational V.

{"page_content": "performance, the extent to which the firms realize these benefits is debatable. Scholars have yet to report findings on the SMA ’ s impact on the firm ’ s competitiveness. While some studies have found a positive association between SMA and firm competitiveness ( Noordin et al., 2015; Oyewo, 2022 ), others have reported an underperformance ( Alhossini et al., 2021; Cescon et al., 2018; Krishnan & Zhang, 2019 ). Oyewo (2022) argue that SMA practices may create a CA, provided firms use these practices intensively. The market and strategic orientation of SMA demands that the firm keep on looking for new business opportu - nities, have a strong customer focus, and have long-term and sustained actions to achieve the firm ’ s objectives ( Boakye et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2009 ). SMA practices add value to the firm performance and can create a sustainable CA. Thus, according to the debate, we postulate the suc - ceeding hypothesis. H1. There exists a strong and meaningful correlation between SMA and CA. 2.1.2. SMA and CS To create, communicate, and implement a company ’ s strategy, management decision-making heavily relies on SMA practices. For these choices to be supported, SMA practices must provide accurate, current, and pertinent management accounting information. As one of the pri - mary information suppliers, management accounting has to ensure that the correct information is accessible to aid management at all levels. Providing a solid investigation for decision-making is crucial for SMA approaches to stay current in this new era, and incorporating big data could help with that. As businesses go digital and more customer- oriented, more data is generated and captured for different business activities. Uninterrupted, accurate, and timely data flow permits firms to gather and integrate comprehensive data about their clients, offerings, customer preferences, production, supply chain, and other operational activities essential for performing SMA practices ( Nielsen, 2018 ). Data generation, access, and analysis should prevent interference and disruption. Increased digital footprints of companies help them gain insights from big data but also make them more vulnerable to cyber - attacks. As the pace of cyber-attacks grows, firms need to have a better level of security and must safeguard their business continuity ( Agbodoh-Falschau & Ravaonorohanta, 2023; Al-Okaily et al., 2023; Arachchilage & Love, 2014; Jain & Raman, 2023; Rosati et al., 2019; Van Schaik et al., 2018; Zeba et al., 2023 ). CS protects a firm ’ s IT assets, such as data, information, networks and information technology systems from potential attacks that can disrupt or alter business operations. Threats to the data and system may come in the form of viruses, mal - ware, ransomware, and compromised systems and services ( Ashibani & Mahmoud, 2017; Pigola et al., 2024 ). It is well acknowledged that CS is critical with respect to accounting information and systems ( Arroyabe et al., 2024; Haapam ¨aki & Sihvonen, 2019 ). Threats to the data and processes may come from both inside and outside sources, such as ransomware ( Banham, 2017 ), compromised business communication ( Herath et al., 2012 ), customer data theft ( Abouelmehdi et al., 2018 ). For regulators and Governments worldwide, CS is a big concern in the financial service industry because of the sensitivity of the customers ’ data ( Lagazio et al., 2014 ). It is imperative that SMA practices, which both generate and require a huge amount of data and CS, go hand in hand. Thus, according to the debate, we postulate the subsequent hypothesis. H2. There exists a strong and meaningful correlation between SMA and CS. 2.1.3. SMA and DT DT is a shift to a brand new way to which technology can be utilized to support SMA and it is not general or universal. SMA is immensely influenced by sectoral and organizational contexts when DT occurs. For example, in manufacturing industries, the use of IoT of devices make it easier to monitor the cost of production and make decisions based on these costs. Also, in the healthcare, hi-tech data and electronic health records take better solutions for the resource planning and costs anal - ysis, leading to better operational efficiencies and predictive planning. In financial services, cost values are optimized, simplified, and made more efficient.

Using artificial intelligence in predicting analytics, retail companies improve many functions of their companies such as pricing strategies, supply chain costs, and customer offerings making their strategic financial planning even better. Furthermore, it has found that the public sector organizations resort to DT for better budget performance and financial responsibility by having automatic systems and numbers to illustrate budgeting. These cases reveal that the impact of DT on SMA is complex and depends on the organizational level of technology imple - mentation, the industry requirements, and organizational preparedness. As such, this study emphasizes how SMA practices must be comple - mentary to the multiple contexts where DT is acting at different levels. Computing and communication technologies are advancing quickly, which has impacted firms significantly. Firms can achieve DT by adopting digital technologies, enhancing the business value manifold. These digital technologies may include mobile technologies, cloud computing, social media platforms, AI & ML, the Internet of Things (IoT), and big data, which change the way a business and customers commu - nicate with each other and the business model altogether ( Chaudhuri et al., 2023; Chaudhuri et al., 2024; Wirtz et al., 2022; Astr ¨om et al., 2022; Tandon et al., 2021; Khanra et al., 2020; S ´anchez & Zuntini, 2018). In DT, these technologies transform the business, including the business model, which is now more digitized, and the value delivery more meaningfully ( Ren et al., 2023 ). Chan (2020) argues that DT is driven by the data generated under an integrated platform, and it enables on-demand solutions for modern businesses. As businesses now communicate with customers through various platforms, a massive amount of data is generated. Coming from different sources, data may be highly heterogeneous regarding raw data and formats ( Gandomi & Haider, 2015 ). Firms ’ desire to leverage the data has resulted in new digital business models where any aspect of business could take a digital form ( Chatterjee et al., 2022 ). However, not everyone is so optimistic in this regard. Quattrone (2016) argues that the digital revolution ’ s effect on management accounting is still not apparent, and it will not result in perfect information and rational decision-making scenarios. Yoon (2020) finds that digital interventions are already transforming accounting processes. The requirement of an integrated management accounting information system platform may accelerate the DT process. Therefore, drawing from the conversation, we Fig. 1. Research model. V. Chotia et al.

CS and CA SMA practices generate and use ever-increasing data, and the amount of data is further expanded by adopting digital business prac - tices. As discussed earlier, data generation, access, and analysis should be free from any interference and disruption, but data in digital form is also prone to cyber-attacks. Incidents of CS breaches may have a sig - nificant impact on the firms in terms of decreased operational and financial performance, lower market value, operation disruptions, reputation loss, loss of customer base, and even intellectual property loss ( Chatterjee et al., 2022; Chatterjee et al., 2024; Garg, 2019; Goel & Shawky, 2009; Martin et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2013 ). Such incidents also increase litigation costs and compliance challenges ( Awan et al., 2022; Demek et al., 2018; Lenk et al., 2018; Tandon et al., 2020 ). This shows that firms should treat CS holistically rather than as a techno - logical project or compliance issue. CS challenges may come from both inside and outside. Increased digitalization increases the cyber threats from outside, but it may also come from inappropriate and unauthorized conduct by employees. In the context of SMA, internal checks become very important. Firms can leverage their existing and other acquired appropriate resources to their CAs ( Huang et al., 2015; Shah, 2022 ). Following the resource-based and dynamic capabilities view, CS capabilities may enable firms to achieve a CA difficult to imitate for competitors. CS also helps protect existing CA as it helps in the uninterrupted supply of products and services. Firms can have a CA through product security, such as in the case of the financial sector, where product security is built around double authentication, digital signature, and other such mea - sures. Customer trust is another kind of moat that firms can develop if product security is a crucial customer criterion. If the information sys - tems are more reliable and resilient, this leads to better customer service and trust, reduced costs and better response to changing business environment ( Horne et al., 2017; Karagouni, 2018 ). Therefore, drawing from the discussion, we suggest the subsequent hypothesis. H4. There exists a strong and meaningful correlation between CS and CA. 2.1.5. CS and DT The pace of digitalization is affecting every industry, and it is espe - cially true in the case of the financial services industry. Recent in - novations in mobile and internet banking, online investments, peer-to- peer lending, and online fund transfer mechanisms such as unified payment interface (UPI) in India have forced firms, not only in the finance sector, to embrace the DT of their operations. More and more firms, to promote business for better reach and collaboration, are shifting their activities to the cloud, but managing operations on the cloud comes with its risks ( Cusack & Ghazizadeh, 2016 ). DT has proved to be a significant force behind recent product and service innovations and sustainable business growth ( Chwi ł kowska-Kubala et al., 2023; Fang et al., 2024; Gaglio et al., 2022; Khanra et al., 2021; Ratna et al., 2024 ). Through big data and business analytics, mobile and cloud computing, social media platforms, and other new techniques such as IoT, firms are transforming how business is being done. CS becomes a prerequisite for the seamless and uninterrupted flow of sensitive finance, customer, and operation data. Even new developments, such as IoT and wearables, are vulnerable to cyber-attacks ( Abraham et al., 2019; Mills et al., 2016 ). Certainly, digitalizing more and more business operations is a call of the day, but a non-holistic approach will result in fragmen - tation and shortcomings ( Bhasin & Rajesh, 2021; Lois et al., 2020; Sousa et al., 2022 ) and resultant mistakes, if they are significant, are not forgiven by customers and market ( Hult et al., 2022 ). As noted earlier, dealing with CS requires a holistic approach, and the primary source of CS risk comes from human behavior rather than from the technology itself ( Eling & Wirfs, 2019 ), and merely more spending on technology will not reduce the risk. It is evident that a rounded approach to CS is required to embrace digital technologies firms. Thus, based on the dis - cussion, we postulate the subsequent hypothesis. H5.

There exist a strong and meaningful correlation between CS and DT 2.1.6. CS and DT as serial mediators As mentioned earlier, the term \"DT\" refers to the process of turning a business into a digital business in which technologies affect every aspect of the business model, including the value offer and the value delivery, in a significant and joined way. In management literature, the terms \"digitization\" and \"digitalization\" have been used interchangeably, and there is no agreed definition of \"DT\". Digital technologies are such technologies which are used by the firms to transform its business and are ultimately seen as digital capabilities ( Iansiti & Lakhani, 2014; Qi et al., 2024 ). To maintain these digital technologies, a firm requires a new set of dynamic capabilities across the value chain, such as dynamic accounting information systems, data analytics, and integrated teams (S ´anchez & Zuntini, 2018). DT involves utilizing these technologies and capabilities to revolu - tionize the business and get a CA over rivals ( Berman, 2012; David et al., 2025; Sonmez Cakir et al., 2024 ). These emerging technologies facilitate the seamless integration of new and existing business processes ( Iansiti & Lakhani, 2014 ) and optimize the utilization of current resources ( Li et al., 2017; Svahn et al., 2017 ). Scholars have found multiple elements that serve as precursors of DT. Organizational culture can have both a positive and negative impact on the process of DT ( Hogan & Coote, 2014 ). Organizational culture has been recognized as a contributing factor to CA ( Martínez-Caro et al., 2020 ). New digital technologies change the competitive landscape, and competition pressure compels firms to adopt DT ( Pizzi et al., 2021; Verhoef et al., 2021 ). DT helps firms deal with and respond to competition quickly and effectively ( Barrane et al., 2020 ). The Firm ’ s existing capabilities concerning knowledge base and adaptability skills help to adopt DT and meet the challenges posed by the changing environment ( J ¨ohnk et al., 2020; Lokuge et al., 2019; Sedera & Gable, 2010 ). IT infrastructure plays a vital role in product differentiation and creating a niche for the Firm, and firms with higher IT adoption capabilities tend to outperform. In financial sectors, where products are natural commodities, DT helps firms create a niche and strong identity for themselves. Thus, according to the debate, we postulate the next hypothesis. H6. There exist a strong and meaningful correlation between DT and CA. H7. The relation between SMA and CA is serially mediated by CS and DT. 3. Methodology 3.1. Research design This study utilizes quantitative research design to analyze the interconnection of SMA, CS, DT and CA. Quantitative data was collected through survey methodology. Considering that the present study has relied on the financial services industry in India, the applicability of these constructs is evidently possible in the domains characterized by the constant launch of advanced products, augmentation of digital threats, and increasing attentiveness concerning information security. 3.2.

An invitation to gather data was sent to a total of 650 individuals, of whom 400 indicated their readiness to take part. Selecting the sample derived from a wider range of options addressed the concerns associated with convenience sampling. Concerted efforts have been made to include all demographic variables, such as gender, marital status, and age. A Google hyperlink was formed and disseminated to the participants to gather their comments. The participants were notified about the schol - arly goal of the research and the strict data confidentiality. Before the study, the questionnaires underwent pre-testing to ensure that the items included were unambiguous and that respondents could understand and interpret them correctly. Pre-testing is a process that identifies and corrects any deficiencies in an instrument before it is given to respondents, either orally or through a questionnaire. This helps to minimize biases in the data collected ( Sekaran & Bougie, 2016 ). Kumar et al. (2013) argue that it is necessary to conduct pre-testing, even when standardized scales are used in a study. A pre-test was conducted with a sample size of 20 individuals, in accordance with the suggestion of Willis (2016, pp. 359–381). The preliminary test results indicated that no is - sues were encountered regarding the survey understanding. As a result, 400 individuals were able to access the Google document. The authors gathered a total of 280 replies, however, 10 of them were omitted for data insufficient. A total of 270 responses were considered for further study. The sample dimensions was determined according to Westland’s (2010) guidelines, which suggest that sample size should be at minimum five times the measurement elements number. A total of 22 items were utilized, necessitating a sample size of 110. Westland (2010) suggests that a sample size of 270 is sufficient for conducting the investigation. The data was evaluated using SmartPLS4. 3.3. Respondent profiles The respondents comprised of professionals from different positions in the financial service industry. Demographic details revealed that there was slightly a higher number of male participants; 55% male while 45% female participants. The respondents’ age distribution indicated that 60% of respondents were between 30 and 50 years old. Professional status differed and it consisted of top management (40 percent), managerial level employees (30 percent) and employees performing technical tasks (30 percent). Having such diverse profiles allowed gathering the variety of views on the constructs investigated. 3.4. Measurement instruments The research has utilized uniform measures or selected specific items from existing scales for the variables related to the structures under investigation, namely SMA, CS, DT, and CA. The measurements were conducted, utilizing a Likert scale, a rating of 1 signifies a profound disagreement, whereas a rating of 5 signifies a strong agreement. For SMA, a 7 item scale was adopted to measure SMA intensity developed by Oyewo (2022). Items included practices like competitive position monitoring, target costing, activity-based costing, value-chain costing etc. The considerations from distinct SMA techniques guaranteed that original analysis was conducted. To evaluate CS practices, the 5-item scale created by Kumar et al. (2021) was modified, with an emphasis on elements like the frequency of cybersecurity assessments and the application of principles like confidentiality and integrity. DT was measured using a 5-item scale adopted from Singh et al. (2021) and Nasiri et al. (2020), that captured the incorporation of digital technol - ogies and the change in business models. CA was measured using the 5-item scale from Saeidi et al. (2019) evaluating profitability, market share, and corporate image compared to competitors. 3.5. Data analysis and justification of approach This research adopted the survey based quantitative method of data collection so as to have accurate measurements regarding the relation - ship between SMA, CS, DT and CA. Consequently, surveys are applicable for studying macro level perspectives and trends in fast growing in - dustries such as the financial services industry ( Sekaran, 2016 ). The entry of validated scales makes sure that constructs are real and accurate in the measures. Also, since the study aligns with the financial services sector in India, there is practical significance in the findings, due to the current advances in digitalization. The methodology is consistent with recent investigations within comparable domains, including Singh et al. (2021) and Nasiri et al. (2020) on DT, Kumar et al. (2021) on CS, and Oyewo (2022) on SMA practices. These references underpin the meth - odological decisions made and locate the research within the interna - tional scientific community. 4.

Findings 4.1. Common method bias The existence of Common method bias (CMB) is one issue that has a negative impact on the outcomes ( Podsakoff et al., 2003 ). Therefore, to resolve the problem, the data was examined for the potential presence of CMB using Harman test ( Islam et al., 2021; Soto-Acostaet al., 2018; Wang et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020 ). Harman’s single-factor test functions as the primary diagnostic tool for identifying CMV because of its broad acceptance for this purpose ( Benzidia et al., 2021; Sinkovics et al., 2018 ). This analysis uses factor analysis to assess measurement items with two objectives: to verify the appearance of one dominant factor or to measure how much a single factor explains measurement covariation ( Kristoffersen et al., 2021; Sahoo et al., 2023 ). The initial factor from this analysis yields an 21% data variation level that fails to reach the recommended threshold of 50% ( Podsakoff et al., 2003 ). The study does not encounter CMV issues since factor analysis showed no dominant single dimension. Additionally, the researchers arranged the items randomly, coded them in a reversed order, and concealed the construct’s purpose and relationship to overcome the socially desirable bias when respondents filled out the survey favorably, thereby impact - ing the validity ( Podsakoff et al., 2012 ). 4.2. Reliability and validity analysis Composite reliability was used to assess inter-item consistency, and reliability coefficient values of 0.70 or higher were considered signifi - cant ( Fornell & Larcker, 1981 ). Construct and convergent validity tests were also performed to see if the items adequately reflected the theo - retical construct under investigation ( Campbell & Fiske, 1959 ). The computed Root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) value of 0.062 and the Normed Match Index (NFI) value of 0.837 satisfied the predetermined standards. Consequently, all of the numbers fell within the suggested cut-off points, indicating a model fit and proving the validity of our methodology. Item loadings of 0.7 and above, as deter - mined by Cronbach Alpha (CA), according to ( Fornell & Larcker, 1981 ), explain half of the item variation, demonstrating construct validity.

{"page_content": "Table 1 shows that Average variance extracted (AVE) values are larger than 0.5, indicating convergent validity. Composite Reliability (CR) values surpass 0.7, signifying an internal consistency. The study ’ s correlations, discriminant validities, and descriptive statistics are shown in Table 2. The early emergence of a positive cor - relation between the constructs supports the idea. As shown in Table 2, the square root of AVE scores is more than the correlation values, indicating that the constructs ’ discriminant validity is adequate ( Anderson & Gerbing, 1988 ). The multicollinearity correlation table was analyzed in accordance with ( Hair et al., 2013 ). Scholars ( Chen & Rothschild, 2010 ) claim that multicollinearity is demonstrated by cor - relation coefficients of 0.9 or above. The correlation coefficients for each of the constructs are all significantly less than 0.90, indicating that multicollinearity is probably not an issue. Furthermore, Table 3 shows that the HTMT value for each construct pair was less than 0.9, supporting the discriminant validity ( Henseler et al., 2015 ). 4.3. Direct effects The data shown in Table 4 clearly illustrate the direct correlations between the variables. The study ’ s first hypothesis was supported by the considerable and favorable effect of SMA on CA ( β = 0.265, p =.001). The study ’ s second hypothesis was validated as the data demonstrated that SMA had a favorable effect on CS ( β = 0.588, p =.000). The study ’ s third hypothesis was supported when the data showed a favorable in - fluence of SMA on DT ( β = 0.373, p =.000). The study verified the fourth hypothesis by finding a statistically significant and positive connection ( β = 0.270, p =.001) between CS and CA. The in - vestigation ’ s fifth hypothesis was confirmed through the identification of a positive and statistically signification relationship between CS and DT, ( β = 0.359, p =.000). Based on the finding of a statistically sig - nificant positive association between DT and CA (p =.314, p =.001), hypothesis 6 was also validated. 4.4. Analysis of serial mediation Table 5 displays the sequential mediating effects employed to eval - uate Hypothesis 7. Research indicates that CS and DT have a notable indirect impact, with an indirect effect size of 0.066 (p =.018). CS and DT are identified as mediating factors in this relationship. The findings support hypothesis number seven of the study, which proposes that CS and DT act as mediators in the interaction between SMA and CA in a sequential manner. 5. Discussion This research analyzed the intermediary functions of Cyber Security (CS) and Digital Transformation (DT) between Strategic Management Accounting (SMA) and Competitive Advantage (CA) in a contingency theory framework. The research aimed to answer three pivotal questions. • What extent does SMA impact CA? • What is the interplay of CS in the relationship between SMA and CA? • Is SMA and CA relationship accentuated by DT? Our research increases the comprehension of the core concepts through evidence which demonstrates a positive relationship between SMA and CA. The relationship between structured SMA aligns with previous academic findings in this direction ( Phornlaphatrachakorn, 2019 ) showing that effective SMA creates competitive advantage and sustainable results for firms. However, in the past findings have given inconsistent and surprising results ( Cescon et al., 2018; Oyewo, 2022 ), which can be justified by the varying degree of SMA implementation practices. Through the lens of contingency theory which postulates that the firms performance is impacted by both inside and outside firm factors, our investigation establishes the crucial role of CS and DT in organiza - tional performance. Our study supports contingency theory because it proves that management practices need to match both organizational context and specific variables. Our research via contingency theory demonstrates that there is high dependency and interplay between the constructs and SMA practices do not operationalize in silos and SMA practices yield different effects on CA based on an organization ’ s ca - pacity for cyber security implementation and digital transformation. Secondly, we studied how CS influences the connection between SMA and CA. The study results validate the positive relationship be - tween SMA-based accounting systems which depend on fast accurate managerial information delivery for their operations.

{"page_content": "theory shows this data flow between SMA and CA requires strong CS frameworks to protect information integrity in order to function adequately. The financial services sector demands strong protection of customer information thus making this requirement vital ( Haapam ¨aki & Sihvonen, 2019; Ortlieb & Garner, 2016 ). Study by Horne et al. (2017) has documented the role of strong CS systems in delivering multiple benefits by strengthening competitiveness and service quality and market agility. The third research question our study focused on was related to examining the role of DT as a mediator between SMA and CA. The research explanation advances both the constructs i.e. SMA and CA and further extends the relationship via contingency theory by highlighting the need for organizations to transform through digital capabilities so that they can respond to their environments proactively. Organizational ability to exploit innovative digital technologies creates both strategic management approaches and industry positioning (Iguina & Riss, 2016). Our research extends contingency theory (S ´anchez & Zuntini, 2018) through showing that SMA effectiveness depends on both internal sys - tems implementation and external dynamics created by DT. The competitive financial services industry operates as a commodity business, wherein DT provides an essential edge that helps companies stand out. Digital transformation boosts SMA effectiveness according to our findings and establishes CS as fundamental to gain sustainable competitive advantage. This dual mediation helps in creating and comprehending a critical framework in which conventional manage - ment methods needs digital trend and security challenge adaptation to enhance organizational success within complex systems. With the given contributions, the research presents academic find - ings which support a holistic method of examining how business stra - tegies connect with contingency theory dispersion. The study is critical in creating an understanding of the interplay between the variables and carving out solutions which can be helpful in gaining competitive advantage by adjusting against external and internal circumstances. 5.1. Theoretical implications The findings of our study have significant theoretical contributions. Our analysis adds to the current knowledge and management account - ing research in some noteworthy ways. First, the research is one of the few that analyzed the moderated-mediated models for SMA and CA in the relation between CS and DT in the financial services sector. Here are two noteworthy aspects. First, we take SMA holistically and do not concentrate on a particular set of practices or a single measure. Some studies have tried to link SMA and relative CA but with mixed results ( Oyewo, 2022 ). Our study puts the notion of a positive association be - tween SMA and CA in a substantial way. Second, this is one of the first studies in the financial services sector. Additional noteworthy research contribution is to examine the mediating moderating role of CS and DT between SMA and CA. As far as we are aware, our research is the first attempt with regard to this path. Studies have examined the advantages a good CS policy offers, such as customer trust and a faster response to changing business environment ( Horne et al., 2017 ). However, we do not see a study that directly links CS with a CA. On the other hand, some studies link DT to CA in a certain indirect way, but most of the studies have limited themselves to ante - cedents of DT ( Martínez-Caro et al., 2020; Verhoef et al., 2021 ). Current literature lacks researches that scrutinize the mediating moderating role of CS and DT between SMA and CA. Our study contributes to the liter - ature by offering a CA model for the financial services sector. This model shows how factors like SMA, CS, and DT shape and enhance CA. This paper improved the knowledge of the antecedents of CA for financial services sector firms. 5.2. Practical implications This research holds substantial practical ramifications for business management, policymakers, and regulators. This study shows that managers must pay attention to a holistic CA rather than concentrating only on the financial yardsticks. CA can be improved if well-formulated SMA practices are in place. SMA will not only enhance both financial and business performance ( McAdam et al., 2019 ) but also cost effi - ciencies over the product life cycle, better accounting system for both products and customers ( Baird et al., 2017; Ng & Wood, 2018 ), Like some of previous studies, our study also confirms a positive association between SMA and CA but as Oyewo (2022) argue that SMA practices may create CA provided firm use these practices intensively. To have a sustainable CA, the firm will have to take a long-term view, and SMA practices are long-term and more customer and market-oriented. It also means that the firm will have to keep looking for new business opportunities, and a market and customer-centric approach certainly helps in that, and SMA indeed adds value to the firm performance.

It also means that the firm will have to keep looking for new business opportunities, and a market and customer-centric approach certainly helps in that, and SMA indeed adds value to the firm performance. Our research as well confirms the vital role played by CS in the process. As business models are now more technology-driven, accurate, uninter - rupted, and timely, data has the potential to become the critical differ - entiator. SMA practices have to ensure that correct information is accessible to support management at all levels for informed decision- making about different business aspects such as customers and customer preferences, production, supply chain, and other operational activities ( Nielsen, 2018 ) and agile CS is a must for data integrity and business continuity. Data threat may come from both internal and external sources and in various forms, such as malware/ransomware attacks, phishing, and customer data theft ( Abouelmehdi et al., 2018 ) and is extremely necessary for an accounting information system ( Haapam ¨aki & Sihvonen, 2019; Zhong et al., 2022 ). Having a sound CS policy in place for the financial services industry becomes even more critical, as customer data is more sensitive. As businesses become more data-driven, and technologies impact every aspect of it, by adopting these technologies such as cloud computing, mobile technologies, social media, and artificial intelli - gence, the firm can transform their business into a digital business ( Engstr ¨om et al., 2024; Wirtz et al., 2022; Astr ¨om et al., 2022 ). In DT, these technologies can transform the business, including the business model, and the value delivery is done more meaningfully. Digitization is especially visible in the financial services industry, and a new term, FinTech, is now being given to heavily technology-oriented businesses delivering products in an entirely new manner ( Alassaf et al., 2024 ). It is evident that to transform the business digitally, a good accounting in - formation system driven by sound SMA practices is required, and sound CS has to be in place. Managers should consider all these aspects to achieve a sustainable business performance and a relative CA. 6. Conclusions This study has explored the intricate relationships between SMA, CS, DT, and CA in the context of the Indian financial services industry. Using validated scales and advanced statistical analysis, the research adds value to the understanding of the relationships of these constructs and the subsequent effects on organizations. The study also shows that SMA acts as a critical success factor for enhancing CA provided that high toned CS measures are incorporated and aggressive DT strategies are adopted. Particularly, those organizations which still adopt SMA prac - tices intensively and, at the same time, apply digital technologies to strengthen their cybersecurity, can perform better in comparisons with competitors in terms of profitability, innovativeness, and customers ’ satisfaction. With data indicating that digital tools and innovations enhance the advantages of SMA methods, the study emphasizes the crucial role of DT as a catalyst in this dynamic. Equally, CS was identi - fied as offering a decoupling layer to guarantee the sustainability of competitive advantages within a digital economy environment. The contributions of this research are both theoretical and practical. In theoretical sense, the study contributes to the existing knowledge on SMA and the interlinked dynamics with other digital and security V. Chotia et al.

In practice, the study provides recommendations to managers and policy makers in the financial services context emphasizing the role of strategic fit be - tween SMA, CS, and DT for realizing sustainable competitive advantage. In conclusion, this work supports the increasing relevance of SMA, CS, and DT in present-day business environments and offers guidelines for organizations that want to harness these components for sustainable success in today ’ s and tomorrow ’ s global economy. 6.1. Limitations and future avenues The present study provides implications, but this research also has limitations. There may be constrictions that prevent generalizing the findings, which can aid as a reason for further investigations. To test the hypothesis, we have used cross-sectional data to check the temporal validity of the results; longitudinal data may be used. Our sample pop - ulation is limited to the Indian financial services sector, and the results may not be the same for other sectors and other geographical areas. Factors other than CS and DT may affect the path to relative CA. The influence of these elements (such as macroeconomic factors, industry competition landscape, and firm size) may be explored further. It will be interesting to see what other factors future researchers would like to use. Similarly, the scope of variables used in the study, SMA and DT, may be expanded or contracted in future research. SMA practices may differ from industry to industry, and similarly, a particular set of digital technologies may affect, more or less, a particular industry. A particular industry may be more affected by a chosen set of SMA practices and form a selected group of technologies. In this study, we have employed quantitative data gathered through questionnaires and have not considered qualitative approaches.

This study aims to investigate the antecedents (both drivers and barriers) of smart city system adoption, specifically those that incorporate artificial intelligence, and to analyse their effects on behavioral outcomes — more specifically, well- being and individual impact. The proposed model was tested using structural equation modelling with data from a survey of 211 individuals in Portugal. The main findings indicate that ubiquity and gamification were the most influential drivers of smart city system adoption. Conversely, perceived risks associated with these systems hindered their adoption. Additionally, our study demonstrated that trust significantly interacts with empower - ment, perceived risk, and usage intention. Finally, usage intention was found to have a positive impact on well- being and individual outcomes in daily life. 1. Introduction In recent years, smart home (SH) and smart city (SC) systems have emerged as some of the most significant technologies in our daily lives, seamlessly integrating into our environments and constantly present around us ( Stojanovi ´c et al., 2023; Teng et al., 2024 ). These systems have expanded well beyond the domestic sphere into the public domain, with a particular emphasis on large, densely populated urban areas. Overall, the SC environment can be described as a space that leverages the Internet of Things (IoT) and data science to enhance the quality of life for its residents ( Allam & Dhunny, 2019; Mikalef et al., 2022; Teng et al., 2024 ). Within these systems, real-time information exchange is possible, bringing both benefits and challenges related to data security ( de Castro Neto & Rego, 2019 ). This is particularly relevant when these systems incorporate persuasive technologies, primarily powered by artificial intelligence (AI), enabling them to adapt to users ’ needs and behaviours ( Herath & Mittal, 2022 ). Although previous studies have explored the drivers and motivations behind individuals ’ adoption of AI-based smart city (SC) systems — often using models such as the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT and UTAUT2) ( Davis, 1986; Venkatesh & Davis, 2003; 2016 ) — further investigation is required to enhance our understanding of these drivers, as well as their outcomes. Several studies, including those by Arfi et al. (2021), Gansser and Reich (2021), Kumar et al. (2023), Teng et al. (2024), and Ullah et al. (2022), have contributed to this area, yet gaps remain. For instance, Sanchez-Sepulveda et al. (2024) have argued that the rapid urbanization of major cities poses considerable challenges to res - idents ’ well-being, particularly concerning mobility patterns, infra - structure, and environmental pollution. Similarly, Mikalef et al. (2022) have proposed a \"dark-side\" perspective to analyse how AI is applied in practice, both to mitigate its potential negative consequences and to prioritise societal well-being — an approach consistent with Barbieri et al. (2025) and Bibri et al. (2024). Although substantial research has examined the societal effects of urbanization, identifying and addressing critical urban areas remains a complex challenge. The aforementioned studies advocate for the adop - tion of data-driven urban strategies to support decision-making by urban planners, architects, and policymakers. These strategies focus on iden - tifying key infrastructure areas to enhance mobility and foster social well-being. * Corresponding author. E-mail addresses: m20180003@novaims.unl.pt (J.P.

{"page_content": "Therefore, this study aims to investigate both the antecedents (drivers and barriers) and the main outcomes of individuals’ intention to use smart city (SC) systems that incorporate artificial intelligence (AI). This research is grounded in the belief-action-outcome framework, widely applied in information systems (IS) research (e.g., Mat Nawi et al., 2024; Melville, 2010; Ojo et al., 2019 ). Accordingly, the following three research questions are proposed. RQ1. What are the drivers of individuals’ intention to use AI-based SC systems? RQ2. What factors influence the intention to use AI-based SC systems? RQ3. How do AI-based SC systems impact perceived well-being and individual outcomes? This study contributes to the field by identifying key drivers and barriers to the adoption of smart environments, particularly those reliant on artificial intelligence (AI). More specifically, the constructs of empowerment, user experience, and accessibility play a significant role in the adoption of smart city (SC) systems. Secondly, it enhances understanding of the behavioural outcomes of SC system usage, particularly its effects on users’ well-being and indi - vidual impact. Thirdly, our study demonstrates that trust significantly moderates both the antecedents and consequences of usage intention. Finally, this study offers practical insights for professionals aiming to improve the acceptance and adoption of AI-driven SC systems through a user-centred approach, facilitating the development of strategies tailored to individuals’ needs and motivations. This paper is structured as follows: The next section outlines the theoretical background and prior research, followed by an introduction to the research model and hypotheses. The methodology is then detailed, leading to the main findings. Finally, the discussion section presents both theoretical and practical implications, as well as the study’s limitations and recommendations for future research. 2. Theoretical background and related work 2.1. Smart cities systems and AI The concept of smart cities is broad and lacks a precise definition within the research community. While it is generally understood as an interconnected, optimized, and knowledge-based high-density urban area ( de Castro Neto & Rego, 2019 ), variations in implementation have led each city to develop its own definition. Table 1 presents different definitions of the smart city (SC) concept over the years. The growing popularity of smart cities and other smart systems has driven improve - ments in usability and security, facilitating greater user acceptance. With the widespread adoption of the internet and the continuous advancement of smart technologies, efforts continue to develop more sophisticated systems capable of autonomously performing human ac - tions. These systems primarily rely on artificial intelligence (AI), now enhanced by machine learning (ML) algorithms that enable more autonomous learning through deep neural networks, which simulate aspects of human brain perception. Over time, this high degree of au - tonomy has fostered a fear of innovation, stemming from these systems’ ability to mimic human cognition and venture into uncharted territories. This, in turn, raises concerns about system security and challenges related to their acceptance. On the other hand, it is also important to understand the potential improvements that can result from adopting these systems and how to develop new strategies to encourage individuals to participate in these intelligent networks. Although these advanced systems are not yet widely implemented, some smart city systems already leverage AI in daily operations. Overall, several areas are being affected by these ad - vancements, including traffic, transportation, utilities, security, sus - tainability, and urban planning. Regarding city-wide traffic management, dynamic routing and predictive traffic analysis are now widely integrated into GPS systems. These technologies assist by using real-time data to identify optimal routes and avoid congestion while also predicting future routes based on common traffic patterns. Other traffic management systems include adaptive traffic signals, which utilize sensors, cameras, and predictive analysis to regulate intersections and dual roads. In public trans - portation, fleet and schedule management systems help optimize routes, reduce bottlenecks, and enable real-time tracking of vehicles for more accurate pick-up and drop-off times ( Dimitrakopoulos et al., 2020; Zannat & Choudhury, 2019 ). In utility management, various systems support energy, water, and waste management. In energy management, these systems leverage smart grids to optimize energy distribution between sources and con - sumers, utilizing an array of sensors, meters, and weather forecasts. This enables the prediction of energy production and minimizes outages, helping to balance supply with demand. Additionally, AI plays a crucial role in integrating grids and renewable energy communities by fore - casting weather patterns and optimizing system usage to ensure a continuous energy supply from intermittent sources ( IEA, 2023; Serban & Lytras, 2020 ). In water management, for instance, systems can optimize supply by adjusting water pressure based on user demand, as well as detecting and managing leaks. In waste management, automated sorting systems can reduce reliance on users’", "metadata": {"producer": "Acrobat Distiller 8.1.0 (Windows)", "creator": "Elsevier", "creationdate": "2025-04-26T08:29:59+00:00", "crossmarkdomains[1]": "elsevier.com", "crossmarkmajorversiondate": "2010-04-23", "creationdate--text": "26th April 2025", "elsevierwebpdfspecifications": "7.0.1", "robots": "noindex", "moddate": "2025-04-26T11:08:50+00:00", "author": "Joao Pedro Ferreira dos Santos", "doi": "10.1016/j.techsoc.2025.102867", "title": "The role of artificial intelligence in smart city systems usage: drivers, barriers, and behavioural outcomes", "keywords": "Artificial intelligence,Smart city systems,Usage intention,Behavioural outcomes", "subject": "Technology in Society, 81 (2025) 102867. doi:10.1016/j.techsoc.2025.102867", "crossmarkdomains[2]": "sciencedirect.com", "crossmarkdomainexclusive": "true", "source": "data\\The-role-of-artificial-intelligence-in-smart-city-systems-u_2025_Technology-.pdf", "total_pages": 13, "page": 1, "page_label": "2", "start_index": 0}}

In water management, for instance, systems can optimize supply by adjusting water pressure based on user demand, as well as detecting and managing leaks. In waste management, automated sorting systems can reduce reliance on users’ knowledge of waste separation. Additionally, bin monitoring technology not only enables smart scheduling of waste collection but also helps establish maintenance patterns for each area based on usage, conserving resources and preventing illegal waste dumping ( Ali et al., 2020; Chaudhari et al., 2019, pp. 802–805). To ensure public safety and security, cities can implement emergency response systems that provide emergency teams with real-time situa - tional awareness through sensor networks ( Huang et al., 2021 ). By analysing historical data, including patterns and locations, these systems help predict crime hotspots and support the implementation of pre - ventive measures such as video surveillance and facial recognition sys - tems ( Tulumello & Iapaolo, 2022 ). Regarding urban planning, leveraging AI-powered smart systems offers significant advantages, enabling the various management systems described above to contribute to the development of a truly intelligent urban environment ( de Castro Neto & Rego, 2019 ). Effective traffic and public transport management are essential for designing a Table 1 Smart city definitions. Definition Source The smart city is an organism with four know stages, being them the “initial stage” where it is defined what the city will become, “vertical” when small parts of the city start to gain autonomy and be connected to the web for information, “connected” when the city becomes interconnected among different services and finally “Growth engine” when the city becomes an ecosystem to boost growth and entrepreneurship with complete data transparency. de Castro Neto and Rego (2019) Smart Cities as an initiative is focused on trying to improve urban performance. Leveraging data, information, and information technologies (IT) to create more efficient services for its citizens, optimize and monitor infrastructure, improve collaboration, and encourage innovative business models in both the public and private sectors. Marsal-Llacuna et al. (2015) A smart city is a highly technical and advanced city that connects information, people, and city elements using new technologies to create a more sustainable, competitive, and innovative commerce, and a greater life quality. Bakıcı et al. (2013) A smart city is defined as one that employs ICT to raise productivity and quality of life to achieve urban sustainability Teng et al. (2024) Source: Authors own work J.P.

{"page_content": "well-structured city capable of accommodating growth and handling large volumes of data in the future. Equally important is the integration of utility management to align supply with demand, with an emphasis on achieving self-sufficiency in resource production ( Koumetio Tekouabou et al., 2023 ). Integrating public safety into this design would help prevent the emergence of crime hotspots and ensure that, in the event of an emer - gency, reliable and efficient routes are available for emergency services. Land and zoning analysis is also crucial for determining the optimal placement of industrial, commercial, and residential areas within the city. Additionally, incorporating environmental planning is essential for fostering a greener, healthier urban environment that enhances overall quality of life ( Burry, 2022; Yigitcanlar et al., 2020 ). 2.2. Prior research Previous research on the acceptance of smart city systems utilizing advanced technologies remains somewhat fragmented. Regarding theoretical frameworks, the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) ( Davis, 1986 ) and the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Tech - nology (UTAUT) ( Venkatesh & Davis, 2003; 2016 ) are the most widely used. Table 2 summarizes the key factors examined in prior research. Studies have highlighted the significance of variables such as perfor - mance expectancy, effort expectancy, and social influence in shaping citizens’ acceptance of advanced smart city systems ( Arfi et al., 2021; Choi, 2022; Gansser & Reich, 2021; Ullah et al., 2022 ). However, given the advanced capabilities of data collection and sharing, some researchers have also examined data privacy and security variables. For instance, studies have highlighted the relevance of perceived risk, fear, and insecurity in the acceptance of smart systems ( Acheampong et al., 2021; Arfi et al., 2021; Distel et al., 2022; El Barachi et al., 2022; El-Haddadeh et al., 2019 ). Finally, from a different perspective, some studies have explored environmental factors as drivers of behavior. Researchers have, for example, incorporated envi - ronmental and social sustainability variables to understand sustainability-driven motivations ( Abid et al., 2022; Zhang et al., 2022; Zhu et al., 2022 ). Despite prior research, an opportunity remains to explore a less- developed phase: the impact of advanced smart city systems on citi - zens. Specifically, studies beyond the adoption and usage phases are limited, highlighting the need for further investigation into how these technologies affect citizens’ lives ( Sarker et al., 2019 ). 2.3. The Belief-Action-Outcome (BAO) framework The Belief-Action-Outcome (BAO) framework provides a conceptual lens for understanding how individual and collective beliefs shape ac - tions and lead to specific outcomes. Initially developed to examine the interplay between information systems and environmental sustainabil - ity ( Melville, 2010 ), the framework is structured around three inter - connected pillars. Beliefs encompass the underlying assumptions, values, and perceptions that influence decision-making, while actions translate these beliefs into tangible behaviours or strategies, often mediated or moderated by contextual factors. Finally, outcomes refer to the resulting impacts, which may reinforce or challenge the initial be - liefs, creating a feedback loop. This cyclical process makes the BAO framework particularly effective for analysing dynamic systems that require continuous adaptation and alignment. Previous research has analysed the role of information systems using the BAO framework. For instance, Xu et al. (2024) examined how in - formation systems (IS) can support community-based sustainability transformations. Based on a case study, they identified a process model grounded in the BAO framework. They proposed three key IS roles: participation objects, connectivity enablers, and fluctuation mitigators, providing insights and guidelines for similar initiatives. Similarly, Isensee et al. (2023) investigated the role of corporate culture in emis - sion reduction within SMEs, using a steel construction SME in Germany as a case study. Applying the extended BAO framework, they identified corporate culture as both a driver and a barrier, outlining an informed approach that emphasizes vision development and the use of informa - tion systems to support sustainability efforts. Using a similar approach, Ojo et al. (2019) investigated the cognitive and attitudinal factors influencing the adoption of Green Information Technology (GIT) among IT professionals in Malaysia. Applying the BAO framework, they identified the roles of GIT knowledge, social influence, and green management culture in shaping GIT attitudes, with partial mediation by beliefs, and confirmed the link between attitudes and green computing practices. Similarly, Mat Nawi et al. (2024) conducted a bibliometric review of 293 publications to", "metadata": {"producer": "Acrobat Distiller 8.1.0 (Windows)", "creator": "Elsevier", "creationdate": "2025-04-26T08:29:59+00:00", "crossmarkdomains[1]": "elsevier.com", "crossmarkmajorversiondate": "2010-04-23", "creationdate--text": "26th April 2025", "elsevierwebpdfspecifications": "7.0.1", "robots": "noindex", "moddate": "2025-04-26T11:08:50+00:00", "author": "Joao Pedro Ferreira dos Santos", "doi": "10.1016/j.techsoc.2025.102867", "title": "The role of artificial intelligence in smart city systems usage: drivers, barriers, and behavioural outcomes", "keywords": "Artificial intelligence,Smart city systems,Usage intention,Behavioural outcomes", "subject": "Technology in Society, 81 (2025) 102867. doi:10.1016/j.techsoc.2025.102867", "crossmarkdomains[2]": "sciencedirect.com", "crossmarkdomainexclusive": "true", "source": "data\\The-role-of-artificial-intelligence-in-smart-city-systems-u_2025_Technology-.pdf", "total_pages": 13, "page": 2, "page_label": "3", "start_index": 0}}

Similarly, Mat Nawi et al. (2024) conducted a bibliometric review of 293 publications to analyse the knowledge structure of Green Information Technology (GIT) adoption and behavior. Two of the five identified clusters of studies were classified as studies based on the BAO framework. Therefore, the BAO framework is well-suited for investigating the antecedents influencing the adoption of AI-driven smart city systems and their behavioral outcomes. As a foundational pillar, beliefs encap - sulate individual, societal, and organizational perceptions of AI-driven smart city systems. Understanding these beliefs is critical for identi - fying key drivers and barriers, as they set the stage for subsequent actions. Within the BAO framework, actions encompass both organizational strategies and individual behaviours aimed at integrating AI technolo - gies. These actions may include investing in infrastructure, fostering partnerships, or initiating training programs to enhance AI literacy among users. Additionally, actions represent the translation of beliefs into tangible practices, such as individuals’ intention to use AI-based smart city systems. Outcomes, the final pillar, are assessed through measurable impacts on individual subjective well-being and broader societal benefits.

{"page_content": "instance, AI-enhanced systems can improve urban mobility, reduce environmental footprints, and promote equitable resource distribution. At the individual level, outcomes may include perceived personal impact and subjective well-being. By applying the BAO framework to smart city adoption studies, re - searchers can holistically map how initial beliefs (e.g., perceived empowerment and risk) drive specific actions (e.g., individuals ’ inten - tion to use AI-based smart city systems) and ultimately result in out - comes affecting well-being and personal impact, as described next. 3. Research model The model presented in Fig. 1 is based on the Belief-Action-Outcome (BAO) framework ( Mat Nawi et al., 2024; Melville, 2010; Ojo et al., 2019 ), which explains how beliefs (antecedents) influence people ’ s ac - tions and, consequently, their outcomes. Specifically, the belief component includes variables that reflect individuals ’ perceptions of AI-driven smart city systems across two dimensions: drivers and bar - riers. This approach aligns with dual-factor theory, which examines phenomena from the perspective of enablers and inhibitors ( Cenfetelli & Schwarz, 2011; Choi, 2022 ) and is consistent with studies on technology acceptance ( Lin et al., 2015 ) and AI devices ( Balakrishnan et al., 2021 ). The action component is assessed through individuals ’ intention to use AI-driven smart city systems. The outcomes include perceived in - dividual impact and users ’ subjective well-being. Finally, perceived trust in AI-driven smart city systems is proposed as a moderating factor in the relationship between beliefs, actions, and outcomes. 3.1. Drivers As explained above, drivers are variables that positively influence individuals ’ intention to use AI-driven smart city systems. According to the literature, the selected drivers are empowerment, ubiquity, and gamification theory. Starting with empowerment, when users ’ choices, actions, and experiences in using or consuming a particular service create a sense of competence and knowledgeability, they typically feel empowered and tend to derive greater value from the service ( El-Haddadeh et al., 2019; Füller et al., 2009; Porter & Donthu, 2008 ). Based on this, empowerment is incorporated into our model to provide insights into how individual engagement contributes to usage intention. Additionally, ubiquity highlights the necessity and significance of networking in most smart cities. From a technological perspective, ubiquity is essential for enabling individuals to experience pervasive computing services on IoT devices ( Angelidou, 2015 ). Thus, the ubiq - uitous characteristics of smart systems are among the core components that positively influence usage intention ( Yang & Lee, 2023 ). Finally, gamification refers to the incorporation of game design el - ements and mechanics into non-game contexts to enhance user engagement and facilitate the completion of challenging or monotonous tasks while ensuring an enjoyable interaction ( Baptista & Oliveira, 2019 ). Within smart city systems, gamification aligns with behavioral patterns outlined in the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and its extensions ( Davis, 1986; Venkatesh & Davis, 2003 ), particularly by enhancing perceived ease of use and enjoyment — two critical de - terminants of adoption. By fostering playful and rewarding interactions, gamified features transform utilitarian smart city systems into more engaging and intuitive experiences, thereby increasing both adoption and sustained use. Practical applications of gamification in smart city systems demon - strate its potential impact. For example, apps like Waze incorporate gamified elements such as badges and points to incentivize users to provide real-time traffic updates, enhancing both system efficiency and user satisfaction. Similarly, Stockholm ’ s ‘Commute Greener ’ initiative utilized gamification to promote sustainable transportation by awarding points for eco-friendly commuting options such as cycling or public transit. These points were tracked on leaderboards, fostering a competitive and socially rewarding environment that encouraged widespread participation and contributed to reducing carbon footprints. Beyond transportation, gamification can also be applied to waste management systems. For example, users may earn rewards for proper recycling, participate in neighbourhood recycling competitions, or receive virtual badges for consistently contributing to waste reduction goals. These mechanisms not only encourage individual behavior but also promote collective action toward broader societal objectives. From a theoretical perspective, gamification enhances user engage - ment by appealing to intrinsic motivations such as achievement, social interaction, and mastery. Research suggests that individuals perceive gamified systems as more enjoyable and less burdensome, increasing their likelihood of participation ( Neves & Oliveira, 2023, pp. 1 – 11). However, the success of gamification depends on its alignment with user preferences and cultural contexts, as poorly designed features may fail to resonate with diverse populations. Therefore, designing gamified ele - ments that are accessible, inclusive, and", "metadata": {"producer": "Acrobat Distiller 8.1.0 (Windows)", "creator": "Elsevier", "creationdate": "2025-04-26T08:29:59+00:00", "crossmarkdomains[1]": "elsevier.com", "crossmarkmajorversiondate": "2010-04-23", "creationdate--text": "26th April 2025", "elsevierwebpdfspecifications": "7.0.1", "robots": "noindex", "moddate": "2025-04-26T11:08:50+00:00", "author": "Joao Pedro Ferreira dos Santos", "doi": "10.1016/j.techsoc.2025.102867", "title": "The role of artificial intelligence in smart city systems usage: drivers, barriers, and behavioural outcomes", "keywords": "Artificial intelligence,Smart city systems,Usage intention,Behavioural outcomes", "subject": "Technology in Society, 81 (2025) 102867. doi:10.1016/j.techsoc.2025.102867", "crossmarkdomains[2]": "sciencedirect.com", "crossmarkdomainexclusive": "true", "source": "data\\The-role-of-artificial-intelligence-in-smart-city-systems-u_2025_Technology-.pdf", "total_pages": 13, "page": 3, "page_label": "4", "start_index": 0}}

Gamification positively influences usage intention. 3.2. Barriers Barriers are factors that negatively impact the intention to use these systems. This study primarily focuses on barriers related to data collection risks, specifically user-perceived risk and privacy concerns. Perceived risk refers to users ’ concerns about relying on a technology that may lead to data breaches, exploitation, or loss of control over the technology ( Distel et al., 2022; Shuhaiber & Mashal, 2019 ). Risk may also act as a barrier to smart environment usage by fostering fear and mistrust among individuals. Regarding privacy concerns, users may worry that the platform lacks adequate security to protect sensitive or personal information ( Arpaci et al., 2015; Habib et al., 2020; Zeng et al., 2023 ). Furthermore, the transmission of sensitive information across different systems in a smart city may create a perception of weak se - curity and instil a sense of powerlessness in users ( Choi, 2022; Habib et al., 2020 ). Thus, we propose the following hypotheses. H4. Perceived risk negatively influences usage intention. H5. Privacy negatively influences usage intention. 3.3. Outcomes Smart city systems offer multiple benefits, encompassing both performance-related outcomes and humanistic aspects, such as enhanced well-being. While Information Systems (IS) studies have highlighted a positive relationship between user behaviour and indi - vidual performance (e.g., Aparicio et al., 2019 ), they have largely overlooked performance outcomes. Furthermore, variables such as well-being have received insufficient attention in IS research. Subjective well-being is defined as a state of life quality and satis - faction in which individual needs are met ( Guillen-Royo, 2019; Mikalef et al., 2022 ). More specifically, Mikalef et al. (2022) proposed a ‘dark-side ’ perspective to examine how AI is implemented in practi - ce — not only to mitigate its potential negative consequences but also to incorporate societal well-being as a key requirement, an approach aligned with Barbieri et al. (2025) and Bibri et al. (2024). In this context, it is crucial to investigate the socio-technical structures and dynamics that contribute to the potential negative outcomes associated with AI and to identify areas where greater emphasis is needed to mitigate such risks. Likewise, Sanchez-Sepulveda et al. (2024) have argued that the rapid urbanisation of major cities poses significant challenges to residents ’ well-being, particularly concerning mobility patterns, infrastructure, and environmental pollution. While extensive research has examined the societal effects of urbanisation, identifying and addressing critical urban areas remains highly complex. Their study advocates for the adoption of data-driven urban strategies to support decision-making by urban planners, architects, and policymakers, with a focus on identi - fying key infrastructure areas to improve mobility and promote social well-being. Based on the above discussion, we hypothesise. H6. Usage Intention positively influences individual impact. H7. Usage Intention positively influences subjective well-being. 3.4. Moderators Smart city systems are characterised by the collection of vast amounts of data, which are sometimes perceived as risky ( Shuhaiber & Mashal, 2019; Teng et al., 2024 ). Therefore, a key factor to consider is users ’ trust in the system, as this may influence their perception of the technology. Trust is defined as a state of confidence that the technology will not harm the user in any way while also protecting their privacy ( Arfi et al., 2021 ). Based on this, we argue that users with varying levels of trust may also exhibit different levels of motivation ( Stojanovi ´c et al., 2023 ). Trust plays a crucial role in determining the likelihood of users adopting smart city systems ( Habib et al., 2020; Teng et al., 2024 ). It significantly moderates user intentions, with higher levels of trust enhancing users ’ sense of empowerment and motivation to engage with the system ( Flavi ´an & Guinalíu, 2006; Ozkan & Kanat, 2011 ). Hence, the moderating effect of trust is hypothesised to positively influence the drivers and their respective outcomes. Conversely, if users perceive the system as risky and doubt its ability to ensure the necessary", "metadata": {"producer": "Acrobat Distiller 8.1.0 (Windows)", "creator": "Elsevier", "creationdate": "2025-04-26T08:29:59+00:00", "crossmarkdomains[1]": "elsevier.com", "crossmarkmajorversiondate": "2010-04-23", "creationdate--text": "26th April 2025", "elsevierwebpdfspecifications": "7.0.1", "robots": "noindex", "moddate": "2025-04-26T11:08:50+00:00", "author": "Joao Pedro Ferreira dos Santos", "doi": "10.1016/j.techsoc.2025.102867", "title": "The role of artificial intelligence in smart city systems usage: drivers, barriers, and behavioural outcomes", "keywords": "Artificial intelligence,Smart city systems,Usage intention,Behavioural outcomes", "subject": "Technology in Society, 81 (2025) 102867. doi:10.1016/j.techsoc.2025.102867", "crossmarkdomains[2]": "sciencedirect.com", "crossmarkdomainexclusive": "true", "source": "data\\The-role-of-artificial-intelligence-in-smart-city-systems-u_2025_Technology-.pdf", "total_pages": 13, "page": 4, "page_label": "5", "start_index": 0}}

In such cases, it mitigates these concerns ( Flavi ´an & Guinalíu, 2006 ), making them less prominent and reducing their impact as barriers to usage. Thus, we hypothesise the following. H8a. Trust moderates the relationship between empowerment and usage intention. H8b. Trust moderates the relationship between ubiquity and usage intention. H8c. Trust moderates the relationship between gamification and usage intention. H8d. Trust moderates the relationship between perceived risk and usage intention. H8e.

Trust moderates the relationship between usage intention and subjective well-being. 4. Methods 4.1. Measurement This study involved the collection of quantitative data through a questionnaire to test the research model. An online questionnaire was administered to gather responses. The questionnaire was developed in both English and Portuguese and began with a brief introduction to the topic, followed by a multiple-choice question to determine which sys - tems the respondents already used. The items for each construct were identified and adapted accord - ingly. All questions were measured on a seven-point numerical scale (ranging from 1 = strongly disagree to 7 = strongly agree). Table 3 presents the item labels for each construct along with their respective sources. Age, gender, and income were included as control variables. 4.2. Data The survey was conducted between May and June 2023 in Portugal. A total of 211 responses were collected; however, after data cleaning and processing, 144 (68%) were deemed useable and complete, which is considered satisfactory. Regarding the sample characteristics, most re - spondents (90%) were between 18 and 44 years old and predominantly female (62%). Additionally, the majority resided in urban areas (83%) J.P.

In terms of net monthly income per individual, the largest proportion of respondents reported earning less than 1000 euros (37%), followed by those in the 1000 to 2000 euros range (33%). These figures align with Portugal ’ s income distribution characteristics ( Rodrigues, 2023 ). In addition to socio-demographic characteristics, it was also possible to assess the use of specific smart city systems across various application areas, including traffic and energy. The most commonly used smart city systems are traffic-related applications, such as transit, parking, ride- sharing, and bike-sharing apps. The second most utilized category is energy-related systems, particularly smart meters and green initiative apps. Fig. 2 illustrates the distribution of respondents ’ usage of smart city systems. Two approaches were employed to assess common method bias. First, Harman ’ s single-factor test was conducted ( Podsakoff et al., 2003 ), using factor analysis to confirm that the first component accounted for less than 50% of the variance. Second, an irrelevant marker variable was introduced, revealing a maximum shared variance of 5.6% with other variables, which falls within the acceptable range. Based on these re - sults, no significant common method bias was detected. The partial least squares (PLS) statistical technique was used to es - timate the research model, as PLS is suitable for small sample sizes ( Ke et al., 2009 ) and does not require normality assumptions ( Fornell & Table 3 Constructs, items, sources, and measurement properties.

{"page_content": "Bookstein, 1982 ). First, the measurement model was tested for reli - ability, as well as for convergent and discriminant validity. Subse - quently, the structural model was tested. SmartPLS ® 4.0 was used. 5. Results 5.1. Measurement properties To evaluate the measurement model, a detailed analysis was con - ducted using three statistical measures: Cronbach ’ s alpha, composite reliability, and average variance extracted (AVE). As shown in Table 3, Cronbach ’ s alpha values exceeded 0.60, composite reliability values were above 0.70, and AVE values were greater than 0.50, thereby con - firming convergent validity ( Fornell & Larcker, 1981; Hair et al., 2019 ). Discriminant validity was assessed using the Heterotrait-Monotrait Ratio (HTMT), the Fornell-Larcker criterion, and cross-loadings. Ac - cording to the Fornell-Larcker criterion, discriminant validity is estab - lished when the correlation between two constructs is lower than the square root of the AVE of each construct ( Fornell & Larcker, 1981 ). As shown in Table 4, correlations were lower in all comparisons, confirm - ing discriminant validity. Table 4 also presents the HTMT test, where values below 0.85 confirm discriminant validity between reflective constructs ( Hair et al., 2019 ). For the eight cases (out of forty-five pairs) where values exceeded 0.85, discriminant validity was verified by analysing the confidence intervals of the specific HTMT values, ensuring they excluded 1 (see footnote in Table 4 ). Additionally, the loadings and cross-loadings met the required conditions, as all loadings were higher than the corre - sponding cross-loadings ( Chin, 1998 ), as shown in the Appendix. Overall, these findings confirm discriminant validity. 5.2. Structural model test The structural model, incorporating the antecedents and conse - quences of usage intentions, as well as the proposed moderator ( Fig. 1 ), was tested using a bootstrapping approach with 5000 iterations. This method facilitated the calculation of path coefficients and their statis - tical significance ( Hair et al., 2019 ). The model explained 82% of the variance in usage intention, 75.5% of the variance in individual impact, and 64.3% of the variance in perceived well-being. We used the adjusted R 2 to compare the two estimated models (i.e., with vs. without the moderator), as it is not influenced by the number of variables. As shown in Table 5, the second model, which incorporates trust as a moderator, demonstrates greater explanatory power for usage intention and its associated outcomes, reinforcing the notion that trust plays a significant role in understanding the user and their intentions. Consequently, eight out of fourteen hypotheses were supported. Regarding the drivers, two of the three antecedents were signifi - cantly associated with usage intention. Specifically, gamification exhibited a positive and significant effect ( λ = 0.483) on usage intention, supporting H3. A similar pattern was observed for ubiquity, which also had a positive and significant effect ( λ = 0.157) on usage intention, supporting H2. Conversely, the influence of empowerment on usage intention was not significant at the 5% level, thus not supporting H1. The coefficient ( λ = 0.126) was significant only at the 10% level. As shown in Table 5, after accounting for trust, the effect of empowerment was no longer statistically significant. Concerning the barriers, perceived risk was statistically significant, supporting H4, with a negative coefficient ( λ = \u0000 0.229), indicating that higher perceived risk is associated with lower usage intention of AI- based smart city (SC) systems. Conversely, privacy did not have a sig - nificant influence on usage intention ( λ = \u0000 0.10), thus not supporting H5. This finding aligns with the low correlation between the two vari - ables ( r = 0.27). Furthermore, usage intention had a positive and significant effect on individual impact ( λ = 0.652) and subjective well-being ( λ = 0.502), supporting H6 and H7. This suggests that respondents with a higher intention to use AI-based SC systems also report a greater perceived individual impact and subjective well-being. Finally, regarding the moderating effects, the findings indicate that trust significantly interacted with empowerment and perceived risk in influencing usage intention, supporting H8a and H8d. Additionally, trust significantly interacted with usage intention to affect individual impact, supporting H8f.

Discussion As we progress into new technological eras and witness advance - ments in artificial intelligence within the context of smart cities, it is essential to understand users ’ willingness to adopt and engage with these systems, as well as their behavioural outcomes ( Grundner & Neuhofer, 2021; Mikalef et al., 2022 ). By examining the key drivers, barriers, and outcomes influencing the intention to use AI-integrated smart city systems, the empirical research presented here offers valu - able insights. 6.1. Key findings First, the analysis of the drivers indicated that two of the three proposed antecedents — ubiquity and gamification — positively and significantly influenced the usage intention of AI-based smart city (SC) systems, contributing to the existing literature ( Neves et al., 2024; Yang & Lee, 2023 ). Our study highlights the importance of ensuring that technology remains universally accessible across both temporal and spatial contexts, leveraging its ubiquitous properties to mitigate situa - tions where users may feel disempowered due to an inability to connect Table 5 Test of the proposed model.

{"page_content": "to the system ( Yang & Lee, 2023 ). Indeed, users are generally more willing to adopt technologies when they perceive an enhancement in their ability to perform daily tasks, fostering a sense of accomplishment. Conversely, empowerment was not a significant driver after controlling for trust as a moderator, underscoring the critical role of trust in the analysis of AI-based SC systems. Notably, an interaction was observed between trust and empowerment, as discussed below. Moreover, integrating game-like features into smart city systems, given their advanced intelligence, could significantly enhance the user experience by making interactions not only more intuitive but also more engaging. It is important to reduce system mechanisation and introduce a more interactive and user-friendly interface. The findings from our study suggest that when these technologies prioritise extending user capabilities and providing accessible and enjoyable interactions, users are more likely to adopt them, aligning with the conclusions of Baptista and Oliveira (2019). Second, concerning the barriers to usage intention, perceived risk had a negative and significant effect, as expected, aligning with the revised literature ( Shuhaiber & Mashal, 2019 ). Our research indicates that users ’ primary concerns revolve around the risk of human error being exploited by third parties, as well as the system ’ s ability to effectively address potential flaws that could cause harm to individuals. This perception leads users to view the technology as risky, resulting in a loss of control or power and increasing their sense of vulnerability ( Shuhaiber & Mashal, 2019 ). The analysis also suggested that the effects of perceived risk are relatively substantial, ranking second only to gamification, highlighting its relevance as a key antecedent. On the other hand, the findings suggested that privacy was not a significant antecedent of usage intention. The lack of significance of privacy concerns in this study can be attributed to various contextual and psychological factors. One possible explanation lies in the regula - tory framework of the European Union, where stringent data protection regulations, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), are firmly established. These regulations impose strict privacy standards, fostering a sense of trust and security among users. As a result, in - dividuals operating within such environments may perceive institu - tional safeguards as sufficient to mitigate privacy risks, thereby reducing the prominence of privacy concerns in their decision-making ( Hamon et al., 2022 ). Another plausible explanation relates to the phenomenon of ‘privacy calculus, ’ whereby individuals assess and balance the trade-offs between privacy risks and the perceived benefits of technology adoption. Research suggests that users often prioritise the tangible advantages of AI-driven systems — such as convenience, efficiency, and quality of life improvements — over potential privacy concerns ( Chen et al., 2024; Guerra et al., 2024 ). In the context of smart city systems, features such as enhanced mobility, optimized energy usage, and improved public safety may offer compelling value propositions that outweigh privacy apprehensions. However, it is important to note that this dynamic may vary in re - gions with weaker regulatory frameworks or lower levels of public awareness regarding data protection. In such contexts, privacy concerns may become more pronounced, significantly influencing user behaviour ( Teng et al., 2024 ). Future research should investigate these variations by examining populations across diverse regulatory, cultural, and technological environments to provide a more comprehensive under - standing of privacy ’ s role in the adoption of smart city systems. Third, the findings on behavioural outcomes — individual impact and subjective well-being — highlight the significant role of smart city sys - tems in enhancing both personal and societal dimensions. Users perceive that their contribution to society is amplified through the use of these technologies. Simultaneously, their subjective well-being improves, encompassing user satisfaction, the fulfilment of personal needs, and overall quality of life ( Mikalef et al., 2022 ). The substantial effect sizes observed (standardised coefficients exceeding 0.5) underscore the strong influence of usage intention on these outcomes, reinforcing their relevance in the context of smart city systems. This contribution ad - dresses a notable gap in the information systems literature, where per - formance outcomes have been underexplored ( Aparicio et al., 2019 ). Behavioural outcomes, such as subjective well-being, can be assessed through metrics including life satisfaction, perceived stress reduction, and improvements in daily mobility. These metrics reflect how smart city systems enhance convenience and efficiency in users ’ lives, thereby improving their overall quality of life. For instance, transportation sys - tems with real-time traffic updates reduce commute times and associ - ated stress, while energy management platforms lower utility costs, contributing to financial well-being. At a broader societal scale, these outcomes have significant impli - cations. The equitable distribution of resources enabled by smart city technologies promotes inclusivity and reduces disparities in access to essential services. Likewise, the adoption of energy-efficient systems supports environmental sustainability by lowering carbon emissions and encouraging responsible consumption", "metadata": {"producer": "Acrobat Distiller 8.1.0 (Windows)", "creator": "Elsevier", "creationdate": "2025-04-26T08:29:59+00:00", "crossmarkdomains[1]": "elsevier.com", "crossmarkmajorversiondate": "2010-04-23", "creationdate--text": "26th April 2025", "elsevierwebpdfspecifications": "7.0.1", "robots": "noindex", "moddate": "2025-04-26T11:08:50+00:00", "author": "Joao Pedro Ferreira dos Santos", "doi": "10.1016/j.techsoc.2025.102867", "title": "The role of artificial intelligence in smart city systems usage: drivers, barriers, and behavioural outcomes", "keywords": "Artificial intelligence,Smart city systems,Usage intention,Behavioural outcomes", "subject": "Technology in Society, 81 (2025) 102867. doi:10.1016/j.techsoc.2025.102867", "crossmarkdomains[2]": "sciencedirect.com", "crossmarkdomainexclusive": "true", "source": "data\\The-role-of-artificial-intelligence-in-smart-city-systems-u_2025_Technology-.pdf", "total_pages": 13, "page": 8, "page_label": "9", "start_index": 0}}

The equitable distribution of resources enabled by smart city technologies promotes inclusivity and reduces disparities in access to essential services. Likewise, the adoption of energy-efficient systems supports environmental sustainability by lowering carbon emissions and encouraging responsible consumption patterns. Moreover, enhanced urban connectivity through integrated systems facilitates community cohesion and social interaction, strengthening the social fabric of urban environments. These findings highlight the essential role of smart city systems in addressing both individual and collective needs. By integrating features that prioritise user satisfaction and societal benefit, these technologies have the potential to significantly enhance quality of life. Future research could build upon these insights by exploring additional behavioural metrics, such as mental health indicators, healthcare system effectiveness, or community engagement, to provide a more compre - hensive understanding of the societal transformations driven by smart city technologies, thereby advancing the existing literature (e.g., Bar - bieri et al., 2025 ). Finally, trust plays a crucial role in moderating the relationship be - tween perceived risks, key drivers, and user behaviour in the adoption of AI-driven smart city systems. As illustrated in Fig. 3, our findings indi - cate that trust mitigates the negative impact of perceived risks on usage intention. Specifically, individuals with high levels of trust maintain consistent usage intentions even when perceived risk is elevated, demonstrating trust ’ s buffering effect. Conversely, those with lower trust levels exhibit a significant decline in usage intention under high- risk perceptions, highlighting the vulnerability created by insufficient trust. Fig. 4 illustrates trust ’ s moderating influence on empowerment, demonstrating that low levels of trust weaken the positive effect of empowerment on usage intention. Conversely, for individuals with high trust, the impact of empowerment on usage intention is amplified, suggesting that trust not only reinforces user confidence but also en - hances their sense of agency. This relationship indicates that trust acts as a catalyst, transforming potential drivers into actionable motivations. Fig. 5 illustrates the moderating effect of trust on the relationship between usage intention and individual impact. Users with high trust derive amplified benefits from their engagement with smart city sys - tems, resulting in a greater perceived individual impact. This dynamic underscores the dual role of trust: mitigating perceived risks while enhancing the positive outcomes associated with system usage. These findings contribute to the existing literature on smart city adoption ( Habib et al., 2020; Stojanovi ´c et al., 2023; Teng et al., 2024 ), highlighting trust ’ s dual role as both a mitigator of risks and an enabler of adoption. By reducing perceived risks while enhancing drivers such as empowerment and ubiquity, trust fosters a stable and conducive envi - ronment for system adoption across diverse user groups. The results further underscore the importance of trust-building measures, including transparent communication, participatory design processes, and robust data protection frameworks. Such initiatives can strengthen user confi - dence, lower adoption barriers, and maximise the potential of AI-driven smart city systems for widespread implementation and meaningful so - cietal impact.

{"page_content": "6.2. Theoretical contributions The present study makes significant theoretical contributions to the expanding body of research on artificial intelligence (AI) within smart city systems, drawing on the belief-action-outcome (BAO) framework. By integrating and advancing this conceptual approach, the study not only corroborates previous findings (e.g., Mikalef et al., 2022; Zhou et al., 2023 ) but also introduces novel insights that address critical gaps in the literature. Firstly, this research enhances the nuanced understanding of the drivers and barriers influencing users ’ adoption of AI-based smart city systems. Identifying ubiquity and gamification as primary facilitators reinforces the dual-factor theory, which highlights the coexistence of enablers and inhibitors in technology adoption ( Choi, 2022 ). However, unlike prior studies that have often examined these factors in isolation, our findings underscore the dynamic interplay between these drivers and contextual elements, particularly trust. The moderating role of trust reveals its dual function as both a catalyst and a mitigator of user per - ceptions, offering a more refined perspective on its influence in smart city environments ( Stojanovi ´c et al., 2023 ). More specifically, this study extends existing literature by demonstrating how trust can shape user empowerment, transforming it from a latent enabler into an actionable determinant of usage intention ( Habib et al., 2020; Teng et al., 2024 ). Secondly, the study ’ s examination of barriers, particularly perceived risk, provides new insights into the psychological and social constraints influencing technology adoption. While previous research has generally acknowledged risks as obstacles, our findings clarify the mechanisms through which perceived risks interact with trust, either exacerbating or alleviating users ’ concerns. This contribution advances theoretical un - derstanding by demonstrating that risk perception is not a static barrier but a dynamic construct shaped by contextual factors ( Distel et al., 2022 ). Conversely, privacy concerns did not significantly affect usage intention, suggesting a potential desensitisation effect among users accustomed to ubiquitous AI applications. This nuanced finding chal - lenges conventional assumptions and highlights the need for further research into the evolving role of privacy in digital environments ( Zeng et al., 2023 ). Thirdly, this research contributes to the relatively underexplored domain of behavioural outcomes associated with smart city systems. By empirically demonstrating the positive effects of usage intention on in - dividual well-being and societal engagement, the study bridges the gap between adoption-focused research and outcome-oriented analyses. The strong effect sizes observed for both individual impact and subjective well-being highlight the transformative potential of smart city systems, extending the literature on technology-mediated quality-of-life im - provements ( Aparicio et al., 2019; Mikalef et al., 2022 ). Furthermore, the interaction between trust and outcomes, whereby higher trust am - plifies individual impact, provides a theoretical foundation for designing systems that prioritise user confidence. Lastly, this study validates the applicability of the BAO framework within the context of smart city systems, reinforcing its utility as a robust theoretical model for examining the interconnections between beliefs, actions, and outcomes. By contributing to the empirical validation of the BAO framework ( Isensee et al., 2023; Melville, 2010; Xu et al., 2024 ), this research provides a comprehensive foundation for future studies investigating complex socio-technical phenomena in urban settings. Moreover, by integrating dual-factor theory and contextual moderators within the BAO structure, the study enhances the framework ’ s capacity to capture the nuanced dynamics of smart city adoption and impact. 6.3. Practical implication This study offers several practical implications for policymakers, urban planners, and technology developers seeking to enhance the adoption and impact of AI-integrated smart city systems. By addressing both the drivers and barriers of usage intention, the findings provide actionable insights for designing more user-centric and trustworthy smart city environments. First, the identification of ubiquity and gamification as key drivers highlights the necessity of creating systems that are accessible, engaging, and seamlessly integrated into users ’ daily lives. Policymakers and developers should prioritise the deployment of ubiquitous computing technologies to ensure system availability at any time and location. For instance, investments in robust IoT infrastructures can enhance the reliability and accessibility of smart city services. Addi - tionally, incorporating gamification elements into system interfaces can transform routine interactions into engaging experiences, fostering sustained user participation. This approach is particularly relevant in public services such as transportation and waste management, where user involvement directly impacts system efficiency. Second, the critical role of trust as a moderator underscores the ne - cessity of transparent and secure system design. Organisations must not only implement but also effectively communicate stringent data pro - tection measures to alleviate concerns about perceived risks. Explicit regulatory compliance — such as adherence to GDPR or equivalent frameworks — should be conveyed through clear privacy policies and accessible information channels. Moreover, integrating features like real-time feedback mechanisms", "metadata": {"producer": "Acrobat Distiller 8.1.0 (Windows)", "creator": "Elsevier", "creationdate": "2025-04-26T08:29:59+00:00", "crossmarkdomains[1]": "elsevier.com", "crossmarkmajorversiondate": "2010-04-23", "creationdate--text": "26th April 2025", "elsevierwebpdfspecifications": "7.0.1", "robots": "noindex", "moddate": "2025-04-26T11:08:50+00:00", "author": "Joao Pedro Ferreira dos Santos", "doi": "10.1016/j.techsoc.2025.102867", "title": "The role of artificial intelligence in smart city systems usage: drivers, barriers, and behavioural outcomes", "keywords": "Artificial intelligence,Smart city systems,Usage intention,Behavioural outcomes", "subject": "Technology in Society, 81 (2025) 102867. doi:10.1016/j.techsoc.2025.102867", "crossmarkdomains[2]": "sciencedirect.com", "crossmarkdomainexclusive": "true", "source": "data\\The-role-of-artificial-intelligence-in-smart-city-systems-u_2025_Technology-.pdf", "total_pages": 13, "page": 9, "page_label": "10", "start_index": 0}}

Moreover, integrating features like real-time feedback mechanisms and error detection systems can enhance user confidence by demon - strating the reliability and accountability of AI-driven processes. These measures are particularly crucial in high-risk applications, such as facial recognition for public safety or predictive analytics for energy man - agement, where concerns over misuse and errors are more pronounced. Third, the study ’ s findings on barriers, particularly perceived risks, suggest that public awareness campaigns and educational initiatives are essential for reducing fear and uncertainty surrounding smart city sys - tems. Governments and organisations can collaborate to develop outreach programmes that inform citizens about the benefits and safe - guards of these technologies. Such efforts could include workshops, interactive demonstrations, and digital literacy programmes to demys - tify AI applications. Additionally, highlighting successful implementa - tions of AI-based systems in other cities can serve as a persuasive tool for building user trust and reducing scepticism. Indeed, collaboration and co-creation have remained a challenge in the smart city context. Fourth, the demonstrated positive impacts of usage intention on in - dividual well-being and societal contributions highlight the need to prioritise user-centric design principles. Developers should create in - terfaces and functionalities that enhance user satisfaction and align with their needs. For instance, systems can incorporate adaptive person - alisation features that cater to diverse user preferences and contexts. Urban planners can leverage these insights to design smart city initia - tives that address not only operational efficiency but also quality-of-life improvements, such as equitable access to resources and enhanced mobility solutions. Lastly, the attenuation of privacy concerns observed in the study suggests that users may become more accepting of AI systems over time, particularly when provided with visible safeguards. However, contin - uous engagement with stakeholders is essential to ensure that these concerns do not resurface with technological advancements or changes in regulatory landscapes. 7. Conclusions The adoption of technology, particularly smart city systems inte - grating artificial intelligence, has garnered significant attention in recent years. This focus aims not only to refine the market orientation of these technologies but also to understand how to encourage citizen adoption and identify the reasons behind the failure of certain ap - proaches. Therefore, this study facilitates the identification of both the drivers and barriers influencing the intention to use these systems. Concerning the drivers, ubiquity and gamification emerged as the most relevant factors. Conversely, among the barriers, perceived risk J.P. Ferreira dos Santos et al.

It is, therefore, crucial for manufacturers, organisations, and municipalities to enhance the drivers while mitigating the barriers. If managed effectively, this approach can improve the user experience and ensure the necessary security measures are in place for individuals using AI-based smart city systems. Regarding the limitations, this study focuses on the perception of artificial intelligence within the smart city context, without considering its implications for smart domestic environments such as smart homes, smart assistants, and autonomous vehicles. Future research could investigate the impact of artificial intelligence on a smaller scale and examine its implications when used in more private settings. Additionally, this study was conducted in Portugal, a developed European nation with high digital literacy and robust data protection regulations, including the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). These contextual factors likely influenced respondents ’ perceptions of the drivers, barriers, and outcomes associated with the adoption of AI- integrated smart city systems. Consequently, the findings may not fully reflect the dynamics in regions with different regulatory frame - works, levels of digital literacy, or trust in institutions. Cultural differences may also play a significant role in shaping adoption patterns. For example, in collectivist societies, where communal values often take precedence, community-wide benefits may outweigh the emphasis on individual empowerment, potentially altering the relative importance of drivers such as ubiquity. In contrast, more individualistic cultures may prioritise features that enhance personal autonomy and customisation. Likewise, societal attitudes towards technology adoption — ranging from openness to innovation to risk aversion — may further mediate the relevance of specific drivers and barriers. Economic disparities represent another critical dimension. In less developed regions, infrastructural limitations and affordability con - straints may heighten barriers such as perceived risk or limit access to smart city systems. These challenges could significantly affect adoption intentions, necessitating localised strategies to address resource con - straints and infrastructural gaps. Future research should examine these dimensions using a cross- cultural and comparative approach to validate the proposed model across diverse regional contexts. For example, studies conducted in emerging economies or regions with varying levels of technological adoption, digital infrastructure, and regulatory stringency would yield valuable insights. Additionally, incorporating contextual variables such as economic development indices, cultural dimensions, and governance frameworks could provide a more comprehensive understanding of the factors facilitating or obstructing the adoption of smart city systems on a global scale. Finally, although privacy concerns were muted in this study, we acknowledge that this may not be universally applicable across all populations or settings. Future research could examine variations in privacy perceptions across different demographic, cultural, and regu - latory contexts. Additionally, longitudinal studies may provide insights into how evolving regulatory landscapes and emerging technologies influence the significance of privacy concerns over time.

{"page_content": "Unlocking financial literacy with machine learning: A critical step to advance personal finance research and practice Alex Yue Feng Zhu * Department of Social Sciences and Policy Studies, The Education University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region ARTICLE INFO Keywords: Financial literacy Supervised machine learning Financial education Personal finance Interactive artificial intelligence ABSTRACT Financial literacy is crucial, and measuring it doesn ’ t have to be expensive. In today ’ s world of interactive artificial intelligence, the reduced costs of coding have made machine learning and text mining viable, cost- effective alternatives to traditional assessment methods. This groundbreaking study is the first globally to integrate diverse fields — such as personal finance, socialization, parenting, and family well-being — to train su - pervised machine learning models for predicting low financial literacy. We labeled a sample of youth in Hong Kong using two definitions of low financial literacy. Our training results revealed that among the four machine learning models trained — decision tree, random forest, light gradient boosting machine, and support vector machine — the light gradient boosting machine was the most effective for predicting low financial literacy based on the first definition (low objective financial knowledge). Conversely, the random forest model performed best according to the second definition, which considers the gap between subjective and objective financial knowl - edge or a deficiency in both. This research provides educators with a powerful tool to identify and offer targeted financial education to at-risk youth. Additionally, the identification of key features through ablation analyses informs the development of innovative conceptual models for future research. Ultimately, this pioneering study encourages scholars across social science disciplines to collaborate, share data, and advance the research paradigm in their fields. 1. Introduction Over the past decade, research on financial literacy has surged, highlighting its critical role as a “ linkage variable ” within the socializ - ation model [ 1, 2 ]. Financial literacy is typically defined as the under - standing of financial principles, instruments, and institutions, along with the ability to apply this knowledge in managing finances [ 3 ]. Youth financial literacy is influenced by both inherent factors, such as age and gender, and external factors, including media exposure, socialization through parents and peers, educational experiences, family economic resources, and parenting practices [ 4, 5 ]. Moreover, financial literacy in youth is linked to changes in financial attitudes, values, confidence in financial behaviors, and decision-making in adulthood, acting as a vital mediator in the socialization model [ 6 ]. Therefore, improving financial literacy is viewed as a pathway to fostering positive financial behaviors and enhancing overall financial well-being [ 7, 8 ]. While standardized financial education in schools is widely recog - nized for effectively promoting financial literacy [ 9 ], the current cur - riculum often takes a one-size-fits-all approach that fails to account for the varying levels of financial knowledge among students. Some youth may already possess advanced financial understanding from parental guidance, media, and peer interactions, making basic instruction potentially oversimplified or contradictory, which can lead to cognitive dissonance. To optimize educational resources, it is essential to focus financial education on those who need it most. Financial educators advocate for a filtering system to prioritize youth with low financial lit - eracy (Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development [ 10 ]. The most straightforward way to identify youth with low financial literacy is through standardized testing; however, such assessments can be prohibitively expensive. The Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) and Financial Fitness for Life (FFFL) tests are among the most credible methods for assessing youth financial literacy globally [ 11, 12 ]. These tests include 48 and 50 items, respectively, covering essential financial literacy domains such as economic reasoning, saving, spending, borrowing, and investing. The extensive number of items re - quires a lengthy testing duration of approximately 40 – 60 min and incurs additional costs for translation and local validation.

{"page_content": "costs. Additionally, low response rates for objective financial literacy tests, especially among those with limited financial understanding, often necessitate strategies like personalized testing or financial incentives to boost participation, further inflating overall costs [ 3 ]. Supervised machine learning (ML) provides a cost-effective alter - native for categorizing financial literacy in large samples, eliminating the need for expensive testing. While previous ML models developed by computer scientists have been able to categorize these groups, their limited focus on personal finance often results in an overreliance on general background variables and a disproportionate emphasis on refining algorithms. As a result, the full potential of ML in assessing financial literacy levels remains underutilized [ 13 ]. Recent advance - ments in personal finance frameworks suggest that financial socializ - ation variables and diverse parenting behaviors are strongly correlated with youth financial literacy [ 5, 14 ], indicating that these factors could serve as valuable features to enhance model performance. Therefore, this research aims to improve prediction features, train four candidate ML models, compare their performance, and ultimately identify the most effective model for practical application. We expect that the finalized model will show significantly enhanced predictive performance compared to existing models in the literature. The findings of this study could have important practical and theo - retical implications. The finalized ML model can be transformed into a low-cost filtering system to identify youth with low financial literacy for targeted financial education in schools. Measuring financial socializ - ation, parenting, and background variables is far more economical than standardized financial literacy tests. In our previous experience, ado - lescents familiar with basic financial concepts typically require at least 40 min to complete the entire FFFL test, while those lacking founda - tional understanding may need even more time if they require assis - tance. In contrast, questionnaires assessing various features of machine learning models, such as parenting, average just 15 min to complete. This efficiency is due to the straightforward nature of the questions, which relate closely to everyday life and do not involve complex reasoning. Furthermore, collecting data for ML features relies solely on participants reporting their experiences, eliminating the need for tech - nical support and further reducing implementation costs. Beyond these practical benefits, training machine learning models produces a valuable byproduct: a ranking of feature importance. This ranking can serve as a crucial reference for developing innovative theoretical models in future research [ 15 ]. 2. Literature review 2.1. Two definitions of low financial literacy Before training ML models, it is important to distinguish between two definitions of low financial literacy. Traditionally, low financial literacy is defined as having low objective financial knowledge (the first definition). However, recent studies indicate that young individuals whose subjective financial knowledge does not align with their objective knowledge also demonstrate low financial literacy [ 16, 17 ]. This in - cludes those who are financially overconfident (having high subjective but low objective knowledge), underconfident (low subjective but high objective knowledge), and financially incompetent (lacking both types of knowledge). This broader definition (the second definition) is sig - nificant, as empirical evidence shows that discrepancies between sub - jective and objective financial knowledge can lead to financial misbehavior [ 18, 19 ]. For instance, financial overconfidence is linked to riskier financial behaviors and poor financial habits, while under - confidence can lead to overly cautious financial decisions that nega - tively affect long-term financial well-being [ 18, 20 ]. The design and cost of financial education programs vary depending on which definition of low financial literacy they target. Programs aimed at the first definition focus solely on enhancing objective financial knowledge, whereas those addressing the second definition seek to improve both objective knowledge and financial confidence, which re - quires more complex and costly interventions, such as simulated financial practice. Therefore, it is essential to train ML models to identify youth with each type of low financial literacy, as this will inform the delivery of appropriate financial education. In practice, schools will select which ML model to use based on their educational goals and available resources. 2.2. Previous applications of ML models in personal finance While ML models have been used in the personal finance sector to help banks identify risky customers [ 21, 22 ], there has been limited research on using these models to detect low financial literacy for educational purposes, particularly among youth. The earliest applica - tion of ML in predicting personal finance outcomes involved Neural Networks (NNs) used by Huang et al. [ 23 ] and Support Vector Machines (SVM) adopted by the same team in 2008 [ 24 ]. Their study, which included a sample of 1010 Australian youth aged 16 to 24, utilized various sociodemographic variables — such as student type, age, gender, marital status, and work status — to predict personal finance outcome variables like credit card and loan statuses. The results showed that SVM outperformed NNs in prediction accuracy, likely", "metadata": {"producer": "Acrobat Distiller 8.1.0 (Windows)", "creator": "Elsevier", "creationdate": "2025-04-26T11:33:10+00:00", "crossmarkdomains[1]": "elsevier.com", "crossmarkmajorversiondate": "2010-04-23", "creationdate--text": "26th April 2025", "elsevierwebpdfspecifications": "7.0.1", "robots": "noindex", "moddate": "2025-04-26T12:07:20+00:00", "author": "Alex Yue Feng Zhu", "doi": "10.1016/j.techsoc.2024.102797", "title": "Unlocking financial literacy with machine learning: A critical step to advance personal finance research and practice", "keywords": "Financial literacy,Supervised machine learning,Financial education,Personal finance,Interactive artificial intelligence", "subject": "Technology in Society, 81 (2025) 102797. doi:10.1016/j.techsoc.2024.102797", "crossmarkdomains[2]": "sciencedirect.com", "crossmarkdomainexclusive": "true", "source": "data\\Unlocking-financial-literacy-with-machine-learning--A-critic_2025_Technology.pdf", "total_pages": 9, "page": 1, "page_label": "2", "start_index": 0}}

The results showed that SVM outperformed NNs in prediction accuracy, likely due to NNs ’ tendency to overfit the limited sample size. Notably, both models focused on financial decisions regarding credit cards and loans, rather than assessing objective financial knowledge. Levantesi and Zacchia [ 13 ] claimed to be the first to predict objective financial knowledge using ML models. They empirically tested and compared the performance of tree-based models — such as decision tree, random forest, and gradient boosting machine (GBM) — to identify Ital - ian adults who did not need to improve their financial knowledge. Their outputs categorized individuals into low and high levels of objective financial knowledge, using inputs that included sociodemographic var - iables (gender, age, education, employment status) and personal finance constructs (financial attitudes, behaviors, and saving outcomes). In contrast to Huang et al. [ 24 ], Levantesi and Zacchia used a larger sample size (N = 2500) and employed multiple performance indicators (accu - racy, precision, sensitivity, and Area Under the Curve) to evaluate the ML models. Specifically, they reported precision ranging from 0.57 to 0.80, sensitivity from 0.61 to 0.72, and accuracy from 0.62 to 0.67. Among the three models, the random forest model (accuracy = 0.67, precision = 0.80) significantly outperformed the decision tree and GBM. Given the actual prevalence of low and high financial literacy levels in their sample (46.5 % vs. 53.5 %), the random forest model demonstrated predictive power but also indicated substantial room for improvement. Building on the literature that has established the initial efficacy of these tree-based ML models (decision tree, random forest, and GBM; Levantesi & Zacchia, 2021) and SVM (Huang, 2007, 2008), this study aims to extend their application to youth in Hong Kong. Additionally, new features, including financial socialization and parenting variables, will be integrated, with the expectation that these enhancements will improve the performance of the ML models. 2.3. Introduction to four candidate ML models Decision trees, random forests, GBM, and SVM are prominent ma - chine learning algorithms used for binary classification, each with distinct strengths and applications. Decision trees are simple, inter - pretable models that emulate human decision-making but can be prone to overfitting [ 25 ]. They require minimal data preprocessing, making them suitable for small sample sizes. Random forests enhance accuracy by aggregating multiple decision trees, thereby reducing overfitting and improving generalization on unseen data [ 26 ]. GBM builds models sequentially, focusing on correcting errors from previous iterations, which often leads to high predictive performance [ 27 ]. Light GBM, an optimized variant of traditional GBM, is particularly effective for com - plex models due to its efficient handling capabilities. By employing a A.Y.F.

Consequently, light GBM was selected as the preferred algorithm over traditional GBM. Additionally, SVM is well-regarded for its binary classification capabilities, especially for its ability to identify an optimal hyperplane that maximizes the margin between classes [ 29 ]. 2.4. Financial socialization, parenting, and financial literacy of youth Financial socialization theory suggests that parents are the primary agents of financial education during youth, exerting greater influence than schools, peers, or media due to their control over essential financial resources and their ability to shape lifestyle and social exposure [ 5, 30 ]. Parents can impact their children ’ s financial literacy through two distinct channels: a direct channel involving observable parent-child financial activities, and a latent channel where parenting behaviors broadly influence cognitive development, including financial literacy [ 2, 31 ]. Specifically, parents can directly affect their children ’ s financial confidence, attitudes, and behaviors by teaching money management, budgeting, saving, and investing skills [ 5, 30 ]. They also serve as role models, demonstrating financial responsibility through their actions and decisions. Consequently, all financial-related interactions between par - ents and children, such as direct teaching, parental role modeling, financial norms, and the overall financial relationship, can potentially serve as predictive features in training ML models for financial literacy. Parental influence on youth financial literacy can also emerge from general parenting practices, which may indirectly affect financial liter - acy. Although the direct connection between these practices and financial literacy isn ’ t always clear, viewing financial literacy as part of cognitive development highlights the importance of general parenting behaviors. Positive parenting, characterized by warmth and responsible supervision, fosters secure attachment, laying a foundation for healthy cognitive development, including financial literacy. Securely attached children are more likely to explore and learn, leading to better cognitive and financial outcomes [ 32 ]. In contrast, negative parenting practices, such as harsh discipline or neglect, can hinder cognitive development, resulting in lower IQ scores and academic challenges [ 33, 34 ]. Such environments can disrupt neural development, impairing a child ’ s ability to engage in complex cognitive tasks, including those related to financial literacy. Recent studies have highlighted the direct correlations between parenting behaviors and children ’ s objective financial knowledge, emphasizing the need to include various parenting behaviors as features in ML model training [ 35 ]. This insight has motivated us to incorporate a diverse range of parenting behaviors into our feature set for ML models, anticipating that they will significantly enhance predictive power. Examining both channels of financial socialization reveals that family economic resources and parental mental health are essential for effective financial socialization and positive parenting. Parents experi - encing material hardship often prioritize immediate needs — such as food, shelter, and clothing — over long-term financial planning and ed - ucation, limiting their ability to impart financial knowledge to their children. Furthermore, financial strain can be a significant source of chronic stress, leading to emotional exhaustion that diminishes a par - ent ’ s empathy, patience, and emotional availability, ultimately affecting their capacity to provide the necessary support for their children ’ s development. Therefore, family material well-being and parental stress levels should be included as additional features when training ML models to ensure a comprehensive understanding of the factors influ - encing financial literacy. 3. Method 3.1. Overall design The reviewed literature establishes a foundation of potential features and candidate ML models for training purposes. Effective features identified in previous research include general socio-demographic and personal finance variables [ 13 ]. Building on these, this study adds financial socialization variables and both positive and negative parenting factors to enhance model performance. We began by using two definitions of low financial literacy to label youth, training ML models to accurately classify them into low or high financial literacy groups. Following established practices, we selected decision tree, random forest, light GBM, and SVM as training models, representing a spectrum of algorithms from simple to complex. 3.2. Sample In Hong Kong, several cross-sectional datasets have examined the financial literacy of youth, with significant contributions from Zhu [ 36 ] and the Investor and Financial Education Council [ 37 ]. The youth sample from Zhu [ 36 ] was selected for its substantial size (N = 989), which supports the training of four ML models. This sample is notable for its comprehensive assessment of objective financial knowledge, utilizing the internationally standardized FFFL test, which includes 50 items evaluating a wide range of financial knowledge and skills. Addi - tionally, the dataset features a measure of subjective financial knowl - edge on a Likert scale from 1 (least knowledgeable) to 7 (most knowledgeable), with confirmed reliability and validity among Hong Kong youth.

It encompasses personal finance variables, family context, parental background, socialization factors, and parenting behaviors, providing all necessary features for training the candidate models. The sample for ML model training consists of 989 youth from Hong Kong, with a slight female majority (55.8 %). Their ages range from 12 to 18, with an average age of 14.5. Single-parent families account for 9.1 % of the sample, and 9.6 % have at least one parent with an associate degree or higher. Housing data reveals that 49.6 % live in public rental housing, while 35.8 % reside in private permanent housing, indicating a higher representation of economically disadvantaged families. Official surveys report that over 60 % of children live in private permanent housing, a figure significantly higher than that in our sample [ 38 ]. The disparity in low and high financial literacy rates, based on two empirical definitions, is noteworthy. The first definition sets a conser - vative threshold of 40 % correctness on the FFFL test, with 68.1 % of youth classified as having low financial literacy. The second definition categorizes the sample into four subgroups. \u0000 Financially competent: both objective and subjective financial knowledge above the mean; \u0000 Financially overconfident: objective financial knowledge below the mean, subjective financial knowledge above the mean; \u0000 Under-confident: objective financial knowledge above the mean, subjective financial knowledge below the mean; \u0000 Financially naïve: both objective and subjective financial knowledge below the mean. All youth in the latter three subgroups were considered to have low financial literacy, leading to 79.0 % of the sample being classified as such. Notably, the proportions of youth with high and low financial literacy were highly unbalanced under both definitions, with low- financial-literacy individuals comprising the majority. In imbalanced datasets, common evaluation metrics like accuracy can be misleading, as a model may achieve high accuracy by predominantly predicting the majority class. To address this, we employed random over-sampling to balance evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score, ensuring adequate representation of the minority class. This strategy A.Y.F.

As a result, the adjusted training sample for the first definition was expanded to 1348 individuals, evenly split with 674 in both the high and low financial literacy groups (50 % each). Similarly, for the second definition, the adjusted training sample grew to 1562 individuals, with 781 in each group (50 % each). 3.3. Measurement of features The features selected for inclusion in the ML training consisted of personal finance factors, financial socialization elements, parenting behaviors, and measures of material well-being and parental stress. Personal finance variables included financial attitudes, perceived financial behavioral control, and actual financial behaviors. Financial attitudes were assessed by asking youth to rate their agreement with three statements: “ Regular saving is important, ” “ Monthly expenses should be tracked, ” and “ Spending should be within a budget, ” based on frameworks established by Shim et al. [ 39 ]. Perceived financial behav - ioral control was evaluated through four items, including the question, “ How easy or difficult is it for you to adhere to your financial plan? ” as outlined by Shim et al. [ 39 ]. Healthy financial behaviors were measured by the frequency of saving, tracking monthly expenses, and adhering to a budget, aligning with the criteria set by Shim et al. [ 39 ]. Financial socialization variables included direct parental teaching, parental financial role modeling, parental financial norms, and the financial relationship with parents. Direct parental teaching was assessed through youth agreement with statements such as, “ My parents discuss the importance of saving with me, ” “ My parents guide me on smart shopping, ” and “ My parents and I talk about financing my college education, ” following Shim et al. [ 39 ]. Parental financial role modeling was evaluated with statements like, “ I consider my parent(s) as role models for managing money, ” and “ My parent(s) positively influence my financial management, ” also based on Shim et al. [ 39 ]. Parental financial norms were measured through youth agreement with state - ments like, “ My parents believe I should budget my spending, ” in line with Shim et al. [ 39 ]. The financial relationship with parents was assessed through items such as, “ Money issues negatively impact my relationship with my parents, ” and “ I frequently argue with my parent(s) about money, ” using Shim et al. [ 39 ] as a reference. Parenting behaviors were categorized into negative types (over- reactivity, verbosity, laxness, spanking) and positive types (parental warmth and supervision), each measured with various items. Negative parenting was evaluated using 24 items from Arnold et al. [ 40 ], covering over-reactivity (7 items, e.g., “ Your parent often insults you or says mean things ” ), verbosity (7 items, e.g., “ Your parent tends to give long lectures ” ), and laxness (9 items, e.g., “ Your parent allows you to do whatever you want ” ). Positive parenting was assessed with 28 items from the Home Observation for Measurement of the Environment [ 41 ], focusing on parental warmth (5 items, e.g., “ Your parent shows physical affection ” ) and supervision (23 items, e.g., “ Your parent sets a curfew on school nights ” ). Material well-being was measured using 22 questions proposed by Wong et al. [ 42 ], such as access to sports and entertainment facilities at home. Parental stress was assessed through 12 items from Haskett et al. [ 43 ], reflecting distress or discomfort in parenting, with an example item being, “ Your parent feels overwhelmed by parenting re - sponsibilities. ” Details on the scales, coding, calculations, in - terpretations of all features, and their descriptive statistics are provided in Table 1. 3.4. Data analysis As previously mentioned, decision tree, random forest, light GBM, and SVM models were employed to predict binary financial literacy outcomes. The performance of each model was evaluated using accu - racy, precision, recall, and F1-score. In binary predictions, the confusion matrix consists of four components: true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives. Accuracy measures the proportion of correct predictions (both true low and high financial literacy) relative to the total number of predictions. Precision assesses the proportion of true low financial literacy cases among all predictions made for low financial literacy (both true and false).

{"page_content": "low financial literacy cases successfully identified by the model. The F1- score, which is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, offers a single metric that balances both aspects. During training, hyperparameters such as the maximum depth of the decision tree and the number of estimators in the random forest were fine-tuned to optimize prediction performance. We also implemented cross-validation to obtain a more reliable estimate of model perfor - mance compared to a single train-test split. Specifically, we used five- fold cross-validation, dividing the dataset into five equal parts. The model was trained on four folds and tested on the remaining fold, repeating this process five times so that each fold served as the test set once. After each iteration, performance metrics were calculated based on the model ’ s predictions for the test fold, and the metrics from all five iterations were averaged for a more reliable estimate of overall performance. Once we identified the best-performing model for each definition, we examined the importance of each feature using ablation analysis. This analysis involved systematically removing features to assess their impact on the model ’ s overall performance. Specifically, we employed a leave-one-out ablation approach, removing one feature at a time while retaining the others for training [ 44 ]. In this analysis, we focused on accuracy and recall. While accuracy provides a general overview of the model ’ s performance by indicating the proportion of correctly classified instances, recall is more critical for financial educators, as it measures the model ’ s ability to accurately identify individuals with low financial literacy for targeted interventions. We established a 1 % reduction in performance as the criterion for assessing feature importance, based on the belief that even a small change can signify a meaningful improve - ment or decline in model performance [ 45 ]. 4. Results Table 2 presents the performance metrics of four machine learning models — decision tree, random forest, light GBM, and SVM — in pre - dicting financial literacy levels. The models were evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score for both low and high financial literacy groups based on two definitions. Under the first definition, where low financial literacy is defined as low objective financial knowledge, light GBM achieved the highest accuracy at 0.8917, closely followed by random forest at 0.8821. In terms of recall for the low financial literacy group, random forest led with 0.8754, while light GBM followed at 0.8516, illustrating both models ’ effectiveness in identifying youth with low financial literacy accurately. For the high financial lit - eracy group, light GBM excelled with a recall of 0.9318, showcasing its strong ability to accurately identify youth with high financial literacy. Overall, light GBM was the best-performing model under the first definition. Under the second definition, which defines low financial literacy as a discrepancy between subjective and objective financial knowledge, random forest outperformed all models with an accuracy of 0.9328, significantly surpassing the others. Light GBM followed with an accu - racy of 0.9033, while SVM and decision tree performed less effectively. For low financial literacy, light GBM achieved the highest precision at 0.9646, while random forest had the highest recall at 0.9078. Random forest also led in F1 score at 0.9308, demonstrating a strong balance between precision and recall. For high financial literacy, both random forest and light GBM performed well, with random forest achieving the highest precision of 0.9129 and light GBM excelling in recall at 0.9692. Overall, random forest emerged as the best-performing model under the second definition. Fig. 1 displays the ablation analysis results for the light GBM model, which was the top performer under the first definition of low financial literacy. Features that significantly contributed to accurate predictions, based on a criterion of at least a 1 % reduction in accuracy or recall, included gender, age, financial attitudes, perceived financial behavioral control, financial behaviors, and laxness. Similarly, Fig. 2 presents the ablation analysis results for the random forest model, the best performer under the second definition. Key features identified included various socio-demographic factors (age, single-parent status, private permanent housing status, parental education level, material hardship), parental financial socialization variables (direct teaching, financial norms, financial relationships with parents), a range of parenting behaviors (laxness, over-reactivity, warmth, spanking, supervision) and financial attitudes and financial behaviors, all of which were important for accurately predicting low financial literacy under this definition. 5.

Our models, which incorporate financial socialization variables and parenting behaviors, significantly outperform the previous model by Levantesi and Zacchia [ 13 ], which lacked these interdisci - plinary features. Levantesi and Zacchia ’ s model aimed to identify in - dividuals with high financial literacy, defined solely by high objective financial knowledge, with a true prevalence of approximately 50 % (53.5 %) in their sample. Similarly, our sample (after performing the oversampling) had a true 50 % prevalence of high financial literacy, defined in the same way. To enable direct comparison, we extracted the accuracy, recall, and precision of decision tree and random forest models predicting high financial literacy from Table 2, as these two models were also trained by Levantesi and Zacchia [ 13 ]. The comparison reveals that our models significantly outperform those of Levantesi and Zacchia [ 13 ]. For the decision tree, our model achieved an accuracy of 0.7619 compared to their 0.6337, a precision of 0.7313 versus their 0.7172, and a recall of 0.8339 compared to their 0.6250. Similarly, for the random forest model, our study achieved an accuracy of 0.8821 versus their 0.6737, a precision of 0.8771 compared to their 0.7992, and a recall of 0.8887 versus their 0.6478.

{"page_content": "Upon reviewing the full results in Tables 2 and it is noted that light GBM performed best for the first definition of low financial literacy, while random forest excelled in predicting the second definition. Random forest stood out in terms of recall for both definitions, which measures the proportion of disadvantaged youth successfully identified by the ML model. This indicator is crucial for policymakers and financial education providers as it ensures reaching disadvantaged youth, regardless of the waste in resources. At the policy level, low financial literacy is closely linked to financial exclusion, social inequality, and intergenerational poverty, underscoring the need to avoid overlooking any disadvantaged individuals. That is why existing financial education programs often target the general youth population without considering the potential waste of resources on those not in need. Implementors of financial education prioritize reaching those most in need, even if it means providing unnecessary education to others. The random forest models with high recall for both definitions of low financial literacy align with this goal, making them a promising choice for government and financial education providers seeking an effective filtering tool. Through ablation analysis, we identified the most influential features for predicting both definitions of low financial literacy (see Figs. 1 and 2 ). Our analysis is guided by the four-stage conceptual model of finan - cial literacy proposed by Goyal and Kumar [ 6 ], which includes ante - cedents of financial literacy, core financial literacy constructs, attitudinal variables, and financial behaviors. Fig. 3 (a) and (b) illustrate that the antecedents of low financial literacy are less complex in the first definition compared to the second. A comparison of the conceptual models reveals that developing objective financial knowledge is more straightforward than achieving sufficient financial knowledge and confidence. Objective knowledge can be cultivated through attentive parenting alone, while establishing both knowledge and confidence re - quires broader interactions, including financial communication and emotional support from parents, as well as active parental supervision. These conceptual models offer valuable hypotheses for future re - searchers interested in exploring diverse pathways toward varying def - initions of low financial literacy. 5.1.

{"page_content": "which may not be the most efficient approach. In behavioral science, financial literacy is valued not for its own sake, but for its potential to drive long-term behavioral change. Similarly, financial education often targets financial literacy as an outcome, viewing it as a means to facil - itate these changes rather than an inherent goal. Therefore, when financial literacy is treated as a construct in exploratory research, using ML models to reduce measurement costs becomes valuable. For example, ML models can identify individuals with low financial literacy, allowing researchers to create a sample that, when analyzed, can pro - vide deeper insights into the socialization processes affecting financially incompetent individuals and inform more targeted intervention strategies. Moreover, the ML models we developed can greatly improve the efficiency of social science data utilization and foster genuine interdis - ciplinary collaboration among research teams. We have pioneered the use of non-financial data to train ML models for predicting financial outcomes like financial literacy. This approach highlights the untapped potential of social science data, which can be discovered through collaboration among researchers from diverse fields. In other words, the extensive panel data collected in Hong Kong across multiple disciplines may currently be underutilized. Additionally, this research is particularly timely given the rapid advancements in interactive AI, which have significantly lowered the costs associated with developing and managing ML code [ 46 ]. This advancement allows ML to be more accessible to the broader academic community, lowering technical barriers. In this context, scholars are encouraged to think creatively, uncovering hidden data interactions across various social science fields and leveraging ML to lower the costs of discovering new knowledge. 5.2. Limitations The primary limitation of our study is the small sample size, which constrained our ability to explore a broader range of ML algorithms, such as neural networks. Additionally, the effectiveness of our trained ML models depends heavily on the accuracy of labeling Hong Kong youth using an objective test prior to training. Although the validity and reliability of the FFFL test are established, alternative objective financial Fig. 2.

{"page_content": "knowledge tests may exhibit higher validity and reliability among Hong Kong youth. The emergence of a superior objective test in the future could potentially enhance the entire ML model training process. Additionally, the burgeoning field of statistical research on financial socialization may introduce new features to consider, thereby refining the feature pool and optimizing the ML model training process. It is also important to note that the best-performing model may vary when this study is replicated in different societies, as influential features can differ based on social and cultural contexts. We encourage researchers in other social settings to replicate this work, as it presents a valuable opportu - nity to explore the interplay between algorithms and culture in social science research. 6. Conclusion Social science scholars have traditionally adopted a theory-driven approach, using data and statistical methods to test hypotheses and uncover new knowledge. In contrast, data-driven technology, often dismissively labeled as “ fishing ”, is typically met with skepticism in social science circles. However, the increasing adoption of interactive AI could unlock the potential of data-driven techniques, such as supervised ML, to enhance research and facilitate knowledge discovery by signifi - cantly lowering the costs associated with ML. This shift encourages so - cial science scholars to reassess the value of data-driven technology [ 47 ]. This study exemplifies the power of ML by training models to identify youth with low financial literacy, showcasing ML ’ s transformative po - tential in personal finance research. This approach not only reduces the costs of implementing financial education but also creates opportunities to improve the theoretical model of financial socialization, promotes interdisciplinary collaboration among social science researchers, and uncovers the untapped value of existing social science data.

{"page_content": "Twin transitions or a meeting of strangers? Unravelling the effects of AI and innovations on economic, social and environmental MSMEs sustainability Joan Torrent-Sellens, Mihaela Enache-Zegheru *, Pilar Ficapal-Cusí Faculty of Economics and Business Studies and ICT Interdisciplinary Research Group (i2TIC), Universitat Oberta de Catalunya, Barcelona, Spain ARTICLE INFO Keywords: Artificial intelligence-based technological sys - tems (AITS) Economic innovation Social innovation Environmental innovation Economic sustainability Social sustainability Environmental sustainability Micro Small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) ABSTRACT This research seeks to expand understanding of the twin transition -digital transformation and socio-economic and environmental sustainability-in firms by examining the impact of a specific digital technology family (artificial intelligence-based technological systems, AITS) and a comprehensive view of innovation encompassing their economic, social, and environmental dimensions. While increasing evidence highlights the influence of AITS on innovation and various economic and firm results, there is a notable gap of studies exploring the social, economic, and environmental sustainability pathways arising from the interplay between AITS usage and different types of innovation. This paper aims to address this gap. Additionally, the study investigates the moderating effects of the digital innovation strategy on the relationship between AITS and sustainability. Using a large, representative sample of 12,326 micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) across 29 European Union countries in 2020, and employing structural equation modelling with partial least squares (PLS-SEM), the research identifies multiple social, economic, and environmental sustainability pathways. The results indicate that economic innovation serves as a key driver of sustainability across all dimensions, positively mediated by environmental and social innovation and the adoption of AITS. Nevertheless, is particularly relevant the finding of a substitution effect between the digital and socio-environmental transitions. For European MSMEs, the digital strategy exerts a negative moderating effect on the relationship between AITS and social and environmental sustainability. The study also uncovers other heterogeneous pathways based on firm size. 1. Introduction The second digital wave positions artificial intelligence (AI) as a general-purpose technology ( Crafts, 2021; Goldfarb et al., 2023 ) and the invention of a method to invent ( Grashof & Kopka, 2023 ). The capacity of AI as a technological platform is driving the development and convergence of various complementary technological families, favour - ing the creation of AI-based technological systems (hereinafter AITS) ( Arranz et al., 2023; Lee et al., 2022 ). The first convergence is estab - lished through the connection between machines and automatic and deep learning algorithms, advances in computing capacity (cloud computing), and the analysis and management of big data (big data analytics). This first convergence can be called AI-based algorithms and software (hereinafter AIAS). The second convergence is established through the link between machines and automatic and deep learning algorithms and the equipment and devices that use them intensively, such as robots or intelligent devices. High-speed computing and communication infrastructures are required for this. This second convergence can be called AI-based hardware and infrastructure (hereinafter AIHI). All this new convergent set of digital technologies and techniques gathered around the transformative potential of AI has been distancing itself from the technologies of the first digital wave (i.e., the non- interactive Internet and information and communication technolo - gies), and has begun to develop a transition process within the digital paradigm and industry 4.0 (hereinafter I4.0) ( Benitez et al., 2023; Eurofound, 2020 ). Recently, these new AITS have been called I4.0 enabling technologies, intelligent technologies or digital transition technologies ( Martinelli et al., 2021; Torrent-Sellens, 2024; Venturini, 2022 ). In economic and business terms, the advent of AITS has led to the emergence of a new source of economic value, predictive value ( Agrawal et al., 2019; Brynjolfsson et al., 2021 ), which has evolved beyond the traditional calculation, information, and communication values associated with the first digital wave ( Torrent-Sellens, 2024 ).

{"page_content": "by increasing polarisation and inequalities, societies are increasingly aware of the need to promote a profound ecological and social transition in their methods of economic organisation and production ( Green & Healy, 2022; Singer, 2018 ). To this end, digital transition technologies, particularly AITS, if implemented properly, can be highly relevant in - struments ( Kar et al., 2022; Nishant et al., 2020 ). Indeed, the ecological transition -with green growth, social and environmental innovation, and the circular economy as its main pillars- and the digital transition -with AITS as the main technologies-are central and interrelated priorities of the current mandate of the European Commission for a double transition towards a more just and balanced digital and socio-environmental future ( European Commission, 2022; Muench et al., 2022 ). Economic and business research has not been immune to the growing social and political demand, which has been organised under the heading of the twin transition ( Chen et al., 2023 ). Research on digital, social, and ecological transitions has made notable contributions from both historical perspectives ( Fouquet & Hippe, 2022 ) and in guiding public policy ( Dwivedi et al., 2022 ). From a business perspective, evi - dence has begun to emerge about the antecedents and initial comple - mentarities of these transitions ( Ortega-Gras et al., 2021 ), as well as some preliminary results ( Montresor & Vezzani, 2023; Rehman et al., 2023 ). Nevertheless, despite the shared objectives of the digital and socio-environmental transitions within the scientific community, the paths to achieving these goals have generated significant political con - troversies and strategic implementation challenges ( Collini & Hau - semer, 2023; Hellemans et al., 2022 ). Technophile or techno-optimist positions, which arise from technical solutionism, argue that the digi - tal transition, particularly the responsible use of AITS, will be funda - mental for optimising and increasing the efficiency of business operations ( Dubey et al., 2019; Dwivedi et al., 2021 ). This new cycle of sustainability is expected to be based on economic growth linked to massive data and tasks and their new predictive values ( Agrawal et al., 2022; Nuccio & Guerzoni, 2019 ). On the other hand, more critical lines of interpretation have emerged. Prioritising behavioural problems and criticising technological solutionism, this literature highlights the limits and contradictions that the digital transition imposes on social and natural systems, proposing scenarios of post-growth, degrowth, and deconstruction of capitalism ( Hickel & Kallis, 2020; Slamer ˇsak et al., 2024 ). In this article, we aim to advance this debate and explore whether innovation dimensions and the digital transition can be leveraged to build pathways toward social and environmental sustainability. To this end, we focus on a specific subset of the digital field — AI — and pose the following research questions: Can AI-based technologies and social and environmental innovation mediate and accelerate the relationship be - tween economic innovation and economic, social, and environmental sustainability? How does a digital innovation strategy moderate and enhance the relationship between AI-based technological systems and sustainability across environmental, economic, and social dimensions? To answer these questions, we draw on a large, representative sample of 12,326 European micro, small, and medium enterprises (hereinafter MSMEs) from 2020. Our results suggest the existence of various possible sustainability pathways for European MSMEs. However, the heteroge - neity of AI adoption and use, geographical diversity, and the inherent limitations of this research call for interpretative caution to avoid excessively technology-solutionist implications and misguided public policies. 2. Theoretical framework and hypotheses Although the direct link between the digital transition and the ecological transition has recently been established as a key objective for a more just and sustainable socioeconomic future ( Diodato et al., 2023; Sharma et al., 2020 ), economic and business research has been ana - lysing the relationship between technology and innovation; environ - mental management strategies, investments, and practices; and business outcomes in terms of sustainability — aligned with the economic, social, and environmental triple bottom line ( de Sousa Jabbour et al., 2018; Ghobakhloo, 2020; Torrent-Sellens et al., 2023 ) — for over two decades.

{"page_content": "Theoretical framework and hypotheses Although the direct link between the digital transition and the ecological transition has recently been established as a key objective for a more just and sustainable socioeconomic future ( Diodato et al., 2023; Sharma et al., 2020 ), economic and business research has been ana - lysing the relationship between technology and innovation; environ - mental management strategies, investments, and practices; and business outcomes in terms of sustainability — aligned with the economic, social, and environmental triple bottom line ( de Sousa Jabbour et al., 2018; Ghobakhloo, 2020; Torrent-Sellens et al., 2023 ) — for over two decades. One widely supported finding is that economic innovation and technology can enhance firms ’ economic, social, and environmental sustainability outcomes ( Adams et al., 2016; Shrivastava, 1995 ). When firms adopt a proactive approach to regulation or environmental quality systems, economic innovation and technology can foster complemen - tary relationships that create win-win scenarios, where the pursuit of environmental sustainability also enhances firm competitiveness. This aligns with the Porter Hypothesis ( Dangelico & Pontrandolfo, 2015; Porter & van der Linde, 1995 ). However, not all technologies or in - novations have similar effects. The literature highlights that technolo - gies or economic innovations that improve efficiency, such as green technologies ( Dangelico et al., 2017; Mehmood et al., 2024 ), or those that drive structural changes in value chains — enhancing productivity or reducing costs — are more effective in promoting economic and social sustainability ( Ghisetti & Rennings, 2014; Ozusaglam et al., 2018; Torrent-Sellens et al., 2023 ). Similarly, research has found clear links between the presence of product, process, organisational, and marketing-related economic in - novations and corporate social responsibility practices, leading to im - provements in environmental and social sustainability indicators ( Aguilera et al., 2024; Mithani, 2017; Saha et al., 2020 ). Technologies or innovations that reduce externalities, such as end-of-pipe environmental practices aimed at reducing emissions or pollution, primarily focus on generating synergies and complementarities with environmental sus - tainability ( Opazo-Bas ´aez et al., 2024; Ramanathan et al., 2017; Rexh ¨auser & Rammer, 2014 ). Given this evidence, the first three research hypotheses of this article can be postulated, both referring to the relationship between economic innovation and economic, environ - mental and social sustainability. Hypothesis 1a. Economic innovation has a positive effect on MSME economic sustainability Hypothesis 1b. Economic innovation has a positive effect on MSME environmental sustainability. Hypothesis 1c. Economic innovation has a positive effect on MSME social sustainability. Similarly to economic innovation, a second important finding iden - tified in the literature is that not all assets and dynamic capabilities generate the same incremental outcomes in terms of social and envi - ronmental sustainability ( Epstein et al., 2015; Singh et al., 2020 ). The theory of dynamic capabilities distinguishes between ordinary capabil - ities, which relate to the normal operations of firms, and dynamic ca - pabilities, which are higher-level assets, resources, or innovations. These capabilities — through sensing (detecting unknown futures), seizing (exploiting valuable resources), and reconfiguring (continuous trans - formation) — enable firms to acquire new forms of competitive advan - tage ( Teece, 2014 ). Specifically, dynamic capabilities can be defined as: “ the firm ’ s ability to integrate, build and reconfigure internal and external com - petencies to address rapidly changing environments. Therefore, dy - namic capabilities reflect an organisation ’ s ability to achieve new and innovative forms of competitive advantage given path dependencies and market positions ” [56, p. 516]. Dynamic capabilities encompass a broad spectrum of skills, pro - cesses, procedures, organisational structures, decision rules, and disci - plines ( Teece, 2007 ).

{"page_content": "towards the identification of opportunities, their exploitation, and sub - sequent reconfiguration to achieve new sources of competitive advan - tage. Among other sources of dynamic competitive advantage, research has identified learning and supporting experimentation, resource recombination, new product development, and transformation of pro - duction systems ( Teece, 2016 ). In this context, research on sustainable dynamic capabilities has indicated that adaptation to environmental legislation and regulations, the incorporation of environmental quality systems, and the mobi - lisation of certain dynamic capabilities are key elements in achieving a return on environmental action ( Buzzao & Rizzi, 2021; Eikelenboom & de Jong, 2019 ). These key factors include a commitment to sustain - ability values and culture, the capacity for absorption and adaptability to external measures, organisational redesign and flexibility, the pres - ence of sustainable assets and management systems, technological innovation, R & D systems, the reorientation of the business model to - wards social and environmental sustainability, the analysis and man - agement of enriched data, the presence of internal and external sustainability networks, and the management of workers ’ knowledge, skills, and capabilities for sustainable human resource management ( Bari et al., 2022; Bhadra et al., 2024; Mousavi et al., 2018 ). Likewise, innovations aimed at social responsibility (social innova - tion) and the ecological or green transition (environmental innovation), when complemented by the use of various digital technologies, yield incremental improvements in both social ( Faludi, 2023; Gupta et al., 2020 ) and environmental ( Cannavacciuolo et al., 2023; Ghobakhloo et al., 2021; Raj & Jeyaraj, 2023 ) sustainability. Given this evidence, we put forward our second research hypothesis, which highlights the dy - namic capabilities linked to social and environmental innovation pro - cesses. In this regard, we propose. Hypothesis 2a. Environmental innovation plays a mediating role in promoting the relationship between economic innovation and MSME environmental sustainability Hypothesis 2b. Social innovation plays a mediating role in promoting the relationship between economic innovation and MSME social sustainability. In the same vein, research on digital transformation has also iden - tified a range of dynamic capabilities for firms and their digital trans - formation processes ( Ellstr ¨om et al., 2022 ). These capabilities are linked to digital sensing, seizing, and reconfiguring and manifest through a combination of changes in culture and values, strategic opportunity detection, modification of organisational structure, innovation and adaptation of the business model, integration of internal and external networks for digital transformation, and the development of new ca - pabilities and skills for employees and managers ( Ghobakhloo et al., 2023; Ghosh et al., 2022; Kopka & Fornahl, 2024 ). By integrating both bodies of literature, recent research on the digital and socio-ecological transition has also identified similar dynamic ca - pabilities and pathways ( Chen et al., 2023; Collini & Hausemer, 2023; Ortega-Gras et al., 2021 ). In this context, evidence is emerging on how firms mobilise other complementarities within the twin digital and socio-environmental transition ( Ferreira et al., 2022; Guandalini, 2022; Opazo-Bas ´aez et al., 2024 ). However, despite the high expectations generated, research on AI and its links to sustainability pathways in firms remains limited ( Chen et al., 2024; Kar et al., 2022 ). There is some evidence of the relationship between AI adoption and social sustainability, particularly in terms of job creation and corporate social responsibility ( Chen et al., 2023; Yang, 2022 ). Similarly, AI usage has been associated with firm-level environ - mental sustainability, especially concerning pollution reduction, decarbonisation, and energy savings ( Dubey et al., 2020; Mehmood et al., 2024; Rehman et al., 2023 ). Lastly, there is also some evidence of the complementarity between AI and economic innovation ( Babina et al., 2024; Grashof & Kopka, 2023; Mariani et al., 2023 ). Given this evidence, and following the recommendations of the literature on AI and its effects ( Haefner et al., 2021; Krakowski et al., 2023 ), we propose the third research hypothesis, which highlights the dynamic capabilities linked to the adoption and use of AI-based technological systems.

Hypothesis 3a. AI-based technological systems play a mediating role in promoting the relationship between economic innovation and MSME economic sustainability Hypothesis 3b. AI-based technological systems play a mediating role in promoting the relationship between economic innovation and MSME environmental sustainability. Hypothesis 3c. AI-based technological systems play a mediating role in promoting the relationship between economic innovation and MSME social sustainability. The concept of the twin transition, which integrates the ecological transition — underpinned by green growth, social and environmental innovation, and the circular economy — along with the digital transition, driven primarily by AI-based technological systems (AITS), represents a key and interconnected priority in the European Commission ’ s current agenda. It has also garnered increasing academic interest due to its impact on firms ’ sustainability pathways. While research has high - lighted the potential complementarities between these two transitions ( Montresor & Vezzani, 2023; Ortega-Gras et al., 2021; Rehman et al., 2023 ), a significant debate remains regarding the extent to which they reinforce or substitute each other ( Montresor & Vezzani, 2023; Rehman et al., 2023 ) and the challenges they present ( Collini & Hausemer, 2023; Hellemans et al., 2022 ). Research supporting the complementarity perspective has provided evidence that digital technologies enable green innovation ( Ning et al., 2023; Wei & Sun, 2021 ), optimise access to resources and value creation ( Castillo Esparza et al., 2024; Martínez-Caro et al., 2020 ), and enhance firms ’ innovation and sustainability performance ( Rehman et al., 2023 ). Industry 4.0 technologies, such as AI, big data analytics, and IoT, have been shown to support firms in achieving green competitive advantage by integrating environmental efficiency into business operations ( Rehman et al., 2023 ). Moreover, a strong digital innovation strategy can facilitate circular economy practices, optimise supply chains, and enhance transparency, thereby strengthening the link between AI-based systems and sustainability performance ( Torres de Oliveira et al., 2023 ). Conversely, the substitution effect highlights the trade-offs between digital transformation and sustainability objectives, where the impact of digital investments varies depending on the composition of ICT profiles and their strategic alignment with sustainability goals ( Tekic & Tekic, 2024 ). While AI-based technological systems have demonstrated effi - ciency improvements, as industrial robots enhance energy efficiency and reduce pollutant emissions ( Zhou et al., 2024 ), their overall sustain - ability impact depends on technological implementation and regional factors. Researchers have introduced the concept of the \"IT production paradox\", suggesting that the adoption of digital transformation can disrupt established processes and organisational frameworks, poten - tially leading to strategic misalignment ( Srivastava et al., 2022 ) and adversely impacting business performance ( Cappa et al., 2021 ). More - over, firms integrated into multinational groups or corporations often face organisational inertia and institutional misalignment, particularly between headquarters and international subsidiaries, which complicates efforts to integrate digital transformation with sustainability initiatives ( Torres de Oliveira et al., 2023 ).

{"page_content": "Given these dynamics, digital innovation strategy influences the relationship between AI-based technological systems and sustainability dimensions, with effects that may be context-dependent rather than uniformly positive ( Lu et al., 2023; Rehman et al., 2023 ). While AI-based technological systems enhance efficiency and productivity, their eco - nomic impact is influenced by firms ’ ability to effectively integrate them into their strategic models, as high investment costs and operational complexities may limit their scalability for MSMEs ( Rehman et al., 2023 ). Moreover, digital innovation strategies often emphasize tech - nological competitiveness and automation, leading to both positive and negative sustainability outcomes ( Tekic & Tekic, 2024 ). However, a misaligned digital innovation strategy may exacerbate workforce displacement and job polarisation, posing challenges for social sustain - ability ( George, 2024 ). The impact of AI adoption on economic, envi - ronmental, and social sustainability is contingent upon the composition and quality of digital innovation strategies, as different ICT profiles yield varying sustainability outcomes. While some digital strategies enhance sustainability performance, others present trade-offs that may challenge the simultaneous achievement of economic, environmental, and social objectives ( Tekic & Tekic, 2024 ). Thus, we propose that. Hypothesis 4a. Digital innovation strategy moderates the relationship between AI-based technological systems and MSME economic sustainability. Hypothesis 4b. Digital innovation strategy moderates the relationship between AI-based technological systems and MSME environmental sustainability. Hypothesis 4c. Digital innovation strategy moderates the relationship between AI-based technological systems and MSME social sustainability. 3. Methods 3.1. Sample This research uses data from the Flash Eurobarometer 486: SMEs, start-ups, scale-ups, and entrepreneurship ( European Commission, 2020 ). The fieldwork was conducted through telephone interviews from February to May 2020. The sample consists of 12,326 European MSMEs and collects information on digital transformation and sustainable development in 29 European Union countries. This database has already been used in several studies on the adoption and results of digital transformation in European firms ( Arranz et al., 2023; Arroyabe et al., 2024 ). The data were segmented by MSMEs size as follows: 7143 microfirms, and 5183 SMEs, with the aim of obtaining deeper insights on sustainability pathways and organisational size differences. 3.2. Variables The construct of economic innovation (ECINN) combines in - novations in products or services, processes, organisational/business models, and marketing/commercialisation. Each component is binary (1, if it applies an innovative practice). The combined value of these components forms the variable, which ranges from 0 to 4. To develop the AI-based technological system indicator (AITS), two constructs were identified. The first construct, referring to AI-based al - gorithms and software (AIAS), encompasses the use of three technolo - gies: machine learning algorithms, cloud computing and big data analytics. The values of this construct range between 0 (no use) and 3 (when the three specified technologies are used). The second construct, AI-based hardware and infrastructure (AIHI), includes the use of three technologies: robotics, smart devices (such as sensors or drones), and high-speed infrastructure. As in the previous case, its values range between 0 and 3. The composite AITS indicator integrates the AIAS and AIHI constructs, resulting in values ranging from 0 to 6. Social innovation (SOCINN) integrates innovations that benefit so - ciety, such as the development of new products or processes aimed at social improvement. Environmental innovation (ENVINN) reflects in - novations that benefit the environment, such as efficiency improve - ments in resource or energy management. Due to the binary nature of the input variables, SOCINN and ENVINN values range from 0 to 1. Digital innovation strategy (DIS) integrates three binary compo - nents: having a strategy or action plan for going digital, pursuing growth via innovation, and aiming for growth through digitalization advance - ment. Each component is assigned a value of 1 if the criterion is met and 0 otherwise. The combined score, which ranges from 0 to 3, represents the extent to which the firm actively engages in and strategizes digital innovation. Economic Sustainability (ECSUS) captures a MSMEs ’ commitment to sustainable economic growth by integrating its sales growth forecasts, employee growth forecasts, and the presence and maturity of a sus - tainability plan.

When combined, these recoded values form ECSUS, with higher scores indi - cating a stronger orientation toward sustainable economic development. Environmental sustainability (ENVSUS) is measured through the implementation of circular economy practices (CIRCSUS) and environ - mental sustainability practices related to products (PRODSUS). CIRC - SUS includes recycling, material reuse, and reduction of natural resource consumption or impact, while PRODSUS includes innovations related to energy savings, the transition to sustainable energy sources, and the development of more sustainable products or services. Each construct has two binary variables, resulting in a range of values for ENVSUS from 0 to 4. Social sustainability (SOCSUS) is evaluated through two constructs reflecting the firm ’ s internal and external social responsibility efforts. Internal social sustainability (INTSOCSUS) includes actions to improve working conditions, job quality, and employee engagement in corporate governance, while external social sustainability (EXTSOCSUS) evaluates actions to promote diversity, workplace equality, and the firm ’ s social impact. Both the internal and external social sustainability constructs have two binary variables, leading to an aggregate range of values for the SOCSUS indicator from 0 to 4. The constructs and variables used in the analysis are presented in Annex 1. 3.3. Analysis The models were examined using partial least squares structural equations modelling (PLS-SEM). The SmartPLS4 software was used both to assess the measurement model and to test the structural model ( Ringle et al., 2015 ). Since this research aims to predict key target constructs without assuming any prior distribution of the data, as a non-parametric method, PLS-SEM is preferable to other covariance-based prediction methods ( Hair et al., 2017 ). 4. Results 4.1.

{"page_content": "evaluate internal consistency, composite reliability ( ρ c) was used, yielding values greater than 0.7. Additionally, convergent validity was assessed by examining the relevance of the outer loadings of indicators, with a critical acceptance value of 0.7, except for the ACT and GVI items, whose loadings are slightly below this threshold, and the average vari - ance extracted (AVE) of all constructs, which exceeded the threshold of 0.5 ( Henseler et al., 2015 ). Moreover, while certain ACT and GVI in - dicators exhibited factor loadings marginally below the 0.7 threshold, their retention was deemed justifiable due to their theoretical impor - tance and the broader model context. In addition, the high AVE values across all constructs indicate that a substantial proportion of variance in the indicators is attributable to their respective latent variables, further reinforcing the adequacy of the measurement model in terms of convergent validity. On the other hand, Annex 2 presents the analysis of the discriminant validity of the measurement models. The square root of each AVE value is higher than the correlations of the latent variables ( Fornell & Larcker, 1981 ), and the Heterotrait-Monotrait ratio (HTMT) is satisfactory, with values below 0.85, indicating that the constructs are conceptually distinct ( Hair et al., 2017; Henseler et al., 2015 ). Additionally, an initial bootstrapping analysis with 5000 samples confirmed that the HTMT values differ significantly from 1, providing further evidence of discriminant validity for all the constructs used. 4.2.

Direct and mediating effects Prior to assessing the structural models, we evaluated the variance inflation factor (VIF) values, which are all below 5 ( Ringle et al., 2015 ), indicating the absence of multicollinearity. The path coefficients of the model and their statistical significance were estimated using the boot - strapping technique, based on 5000 subsamples. One-tailed tests of direct effects were performed using a Student ’ s t-distribution with a 95% confidence interval. Annex 3 presents all the tables that reflect the direct effects, their significance, explained variance, and effect size for each of the firms analysed. In all of them, it is observed that the direct effects are significant at the 0.001 level (t ≥ 3.092) and that the confidence in - tervals do not include the value 0, with the exception of the moderating effect of Digital innovation strategy in the relationship between AI-based technological systems and economic sustainability for small and middle size firms and the total sample of MSMEs. Similarly, Annex 4 presents the results of the hypothesised indirect effects for each of the firm dimension. As in the previous case, the values of the indirect co - efficients, their significance, and interpretation are presented. Thus, economic innovation provides a basis for assessing the mediating role of social and environmental innovations and AI-based technological sys - tems as well as for establishing pathways towards social, economic, and environmental sustainability. Furthermore, the moderating effect of AI-based technological systems on the sustainability dimensions is also evaluated. In general, the R2 values exceed 0.1, indicating an adequate explanatory power ( Srivastava et al., 2022 ), except for the construct of AI-based technological systems, Environmental innovation, in the case of microfirms and Economic sustainability in the case of small and medium size companies. Environmental sustainability exhibits the highest explained variance in the case of small and middle size firms (0.258), followed by social sustainability (0.247) in the same group of companies. Cohen ’ s f2 was used to evaluate the effect size, many pathways meet or exceed the Cohen ’ s threshold of 0.02, indicating significant effects. This suggests that most of the study variables are significant predictors of their respective exogenous variables ( Rold ´an & S ´anchez-Franco, 2012 ). However, several pathways, especially those involving DIS as a moderator, fall below this threshold, suggesting weaker effects in those cases. Overall, the majority of direct effects on sustainability measures are significant, with particularly strong in - fluences noted in ECINN to AITS and environmental or social innovations. In Fig. 1, the sustainability pathways for microfirms are shown. All direct effects are significant, as reflected in Table A.3.1. Economic innovation is a driver of AI-based technological system adoption ( β = 0.288, p < 0.001).

Economic innovation drives the adoption and development of AI-based technological systems, which, in turn, positively affect sustainability dimensions. In other words, the ability of AI to improve efficiency, optimise processes, develop sustainable products, and manage resources more effectively is essential for translating economic innovation into circular economy practices and the environmental sustainability of products.

{"page_content": "enhances economic sustainability outcomes, it appears to constrain the environmental and social benefits of AI adoption (see Fig. 1 and Table A.3.1 ). In the case of environmental sustainability, the negative moderation effect of DIS suggests that an overly focused on automation and control digital innovation strategy may reduce the positive influ - ence of AI-based technological adoption. This finding indicates that highly structured strategic frameworks could limit the flexibility required for AI to effectively drive sustainability-oriented environ - mental innovations. Microfirms that impose rigid digital strategies may struggle to leverage AI ’ s full potential for optimising resource efficiency, saving energy, switching to sustainable energy sources, and advancing circular economy practices. Conversely, for economic sustainability, DIS exerts a positive moderation effect, reinforcing the economic benefits derived from AI adoption. However, the findings for social sustainability reveal a nega - tive moderation effect, suggesting that DIS may impose constraints on AI ’ s ability to foster socially responsible practices. While AI adoption generally supports social sustainability through improved organiza - tional efficiency and stakeholder engagement, a digital strategy focused on automation and control may limit adaptability, reducing AI ’ s effec - tiveness in enhancing internal and external social responsibility efforts. Finally, the model highlights that ENVSUS (R 2 = 0.193) and ECSUS (R 2 = 0.123) have moderate explanatory power, with SOCSUS showing the strongest explained variance (22.1%). Fig. 2 reflects sustainability pathways for European SMEs. The direct effect of economic innovation on AI-based technological systems is significant ( β = 0.309, p < 0.001).), indicating that increases in product, process, organisational, or commercial innovation are associated with greater adoption of AI-based technologies, thus suggesting that firms with innovative practices tend to adopt more AI technologies. Addi - tionally, as reflected in Table A.3.2., there is a significant direct rela - tionship between economic innovation and social and ( β = 0.116, p < 0.001) environmental innovation ( β = 0.099, p < 0.001), which in turn positively affects social and environmental sustainability ( β = 0.357 and 0.515, respectively, p < 0.001). Furthermore, AI-based technological systems significantly impact both environmental ( β = 0.306, p < 0.001) economic sustainability (ECSUS) ( β = 0.177, p < 0.001), and social sustainability ( β = 0.338, p < 0.001). This indicates that firms gener - ating more social and environmental innovations and those adopting AI tend to implement more circular economy practices and product-related environmental sustainability practices, as well as demonstrate internal and external social responsibility efforts. The model explains 25.8% of the variance in environmental sustainability and 24.7% of the variance in social sustainability. The moderation results indicate that Digital Innovation Strategy (DIS) plays a complex role in shaping the impact of AI-based techno - logical system (AITS) adoption on sustainability dimensions in SMEs. While AI adoption positively influences all sustainability dimensions, the interaction with DIS exhibits mixed effects, with respect to eco - nomic, environmental, and social sustainability. For environmental sustainability, the negative moderation effect ( β = \u0000 0.173, p < 0.001) suggests that a strong DIS reduces the positive influence of AI adoption on environmental outcomes. This finding im - plies that overly structured digital strategies may constrain AI ’ s poten - tial to drive ecological improvements, possibly by limiting the flexibility needed for AI-driven resource optimization and circular economy practices. In the case of economic sustainability, the moderation effect of DIS is not statistically significant ( β = \u0000 0.020, t = 0.671, p > 0.05), indicating that DIS does not substantially alter the relationship between AI adop - tion and economic outcomes. This suggests that, unlike in microfirms, SMEs may already benefit from AI-driven economic gains regardless of the level of digital strategy implementation. For social sustainability, DIS exerts a significant negative moderation effect ( β = \u0000 0.219, t = 8.370, p < 0.001), indicating that a strong digital strategy weakens AI ’ s positive impact on social sustainability. For the total sample, economic innovation also positively impacts social innovation ( β = 0.127, p < 0.001) and environmental innovation ( β = 0.098 p < 0.001). Social innovation drives social sustainability ( β = 0.350 p < 0.001), demonstrating that societal-focused innovations are essential for improving internal and external social responsibility.

Similarly, environmental innovation positively contributes to environ - mental sustainability ( β = 0.544, p < 0.001), as reflected in Table A.3.3. The moderation results for the total sample (MSMEs) reinforce the findings observed separately for microfirms and SMEs, highlighting a complex role of DIS in shaping the impact of AI-based technological system (AITS) adoption on sustainability dimensions. For environmental sustainability, DIS exhibits a significant negative moderation effect ( β = \u0000 0.152, p < 0.001). This result is consistent with the negative moderation effects observed in both microfirms and SMEs, suggesting that rigid strategic frameworks may hinder AI-driven ecological improvements. Regarding economic sustainability, the moderation effect of DIS is not significant ( β = \u0000 0.000, t = 0.020, p > 0.05), confirming the pattern observed in SMEs, where digital strategy does not substantially alter the relationship between AI adoption and financial performance. This sug - gests that AI ’ s economic benefits materialize independently of the level of strategic digitalization. For social sustainability, DIS again negatively moderates the effect of AI adoption ( β = \u0000 0.207, t = 11.615, p < 0.001), reinforcing the results from microfirms and SMEs. This suggests that while AI positively con - tributes to social sustainability, a highly structured digital strategy may introduce constraints that reduce its effectiveness in fostering socially responsible business practices (see Fig. 3 ). The model highlights that economic innovation and AITS are central to achieving sustainability outcomes in European microfirms and SMEs. Social innovation is a key driver of social sustainability, while envi - ronmental innovation and digital strategies contribute to environmental goals. The relationships suggest that combining innovation and tech - nology can significantly enhance sustainability practices across diverse dimensions in this group of firms. 4.2.2. Hypotheses testing The hypotheses testing results reveal distinct patterns across micro - firms, SMEs, and the total sample, highlighting the varying impacts of economic innovation and AI-based technological systems on sustain - ability outcomes. The research results confirm that economic innovation positively influences economic, environmental, and social sustainability in Euro - pean microfirms, SMEs, and MSMEs. However, the magnitude of these effects varies, suggesting that firm size plays an important role in determining the extent to which economic innovation contributes to sustainability. Regarding economic sustainability, the results indicate that eco - nomic innovation exerts a statistically significant positive effect across all firm sizes, thus supporting Hypothesis 1a. These results are consistent with previous research ( Ghisetti & Rennings, 2014; Ozusaglam et al., 2018; Torrent-Sellens et al., 2023 ). However, the strength of the rela - tionship varies, with the highest effect observed in microfirms ( β = 0.219, p < 0.001), followed by MSMEs ( β = 0.203, p < 0.001), and the lowest in SMEs ( β = 0.169, p < 0.001). These findings suggest that smaller firms may be more agile in integrating economic innovations to enhance their economic sustainability.

Economic innovation significantly en - hances environmental sustainability in microfirms ( β = 0.127, p < 0.001), MSMEs ( β = 0.120, p < 0.001), and SMEs ( β = 0.111, p < 0.001). The impact of economic innovation on social sustainability is also statistically significant across all firm sizes, thereby confirming Hy - pothesis 1c and aligning with previous research findings ( Aguilera et al., 2024; Mithani, 2017; Saha et al., 2020 ). However, the effect is strongest in microfirms ( β = 0.144, p < 0.001), followed by MSMEs ( β = 0.129, p < 0.001), and weakest in SMEs ( β = 0.105, p < 0.001). These findings indicate that smaller firms may be more effective in translating eco - nomic innovation into social benefits, such as improved working con - ditions, employee engagement, and stakeholder relationships. Hypotheses 2 and 3 tested the mediating effect of green innovation, social innovation, and AI-based technological systems in linking eco - nomic innovation to sustainability dimensions. The results confirm that green innovation partially mediates the relationship between economic innovation and environmental sustainability (H2a) across microfirms and SMEs, with the effect being strongest in microfirms ( β = 0.054, t = 12.905, p < 0.001), followed by MSMEs ( β = 0.044, t = 14.045, p < 0.001), and slightly lower in SMEs ( β = 0.041, t = 9.575, p < 0.001). These results support Hypothesis 2a, indicating that microfirms may be more agile in implementing green innovation strategies that enhance environmental sustainability. Similarly, the results show that social innovation significantly me - diates the relationship between economic innovation and social sus - tainability (H2b) in microfirms and SMEs. The effect is strongest for SMEs ( β = 0.055, t = 7.809, p < 0.001), followed by MSMEs ( β = 0.055, t = 12.723, p < 0.001), and slightly lower for microfirms ( β = 0.046, t = 9.909, p < 0.001). These findings confirm Hypothesis 2b. The results confirm that AI-based technological systems partially mediate the relationship between economic innovation and economic sustainability (H3a) across all firm sizes, The mediation effect is stron - gest in microfirms ( β = 0.040, t = 7.869, p < 0.001), followed by SMEs ( β = 0.026, t = 11.202, p < 0.001), and lower in MSMEs ( β = 0.022, t = 14.774, p < 0.001), thus supporting Hypothesis 3a. The stronger mediation effect in microfirms suggests that small businesses are more agile in integrating AI-driven solutions to enhance economic sustain - ability, likely due to fewer bureaucratic barriers and a greater need for efficiency improvements. The weaker mediation effect in SMEs suggests that AI adoption may be more complex at larger scales, requiring more extensive infrastructure and workforce training. The results also indicate that AI-based technological systems partially mediate the relationship between economic innovation and environmental sustainability (H3b), with the strongest effect in SMEs ( β = 0.094, t = 13.631, p < 0.001), followed by MSMEs ( β = 0.082, t = 17.860, p < 0.001), and significantly lower in microfirms ( β = 0.014, t = 8.767, p < 0.001), confirming Hypothesis 3b.

While microfirms excel in leveraging AI for economic and social sustainability, SMEs are more effective in utilizing AI for environmental sustainability. The MSME-level results closely mirror SME trends, reinforcing the notion that larger firms within the MSME category tend to shape overall sustainability mediation patterns. 4.2.3. Moderating effects The moderating effects of the digital innovation strategy (DIS) on the relationship between AI-based technological systems (AITS) and sus - tainability dimensions — economic, environmental, and social — exhibit distinct patterns when segmented by organizational size, reflecting the unique challenges and priorities of microfirms and SMEs. For micro - firms, DIS positively moderates the relationship between AITS and economic sustainability, with a coefficient of 0.069 (p < 0.001), sug - gesting that a strong digital innovation strategy enhances the ability of AI technologies to support sustainable economic growth. This finding indicates that microfirms with well-defined digital strategies can better utilize AI technologies to align their economic growth with sustain - ability goals. However, DIS has a negative moderating effect on the relationship between AITS and environmental sustainability, with a coefficient of \u0000 0.146 (p < 0.001). This implies that while microfirms adopt digital strategies, these strategies may not be effectively inte - grated with AI technologies to achieve environmental goals, potentially due to resource constraints or limited expertise. Similarly, DIS nega - tively moderates the relationship between AITS and social sustainabil - ity, with a significant coefficient of \u0000 0.192 (p < 0.001), suggesting that the implementation of digital strategies may create tension or trade-offs with efforts to enhance social responsibility in microfirms, which often operate with constrained resources. In SMEs, the moderating effects of DIS reveal consistent negative relationships across all dimensions of sustainability, except the eco - nomic dimension. The relationship between AITS and economic sus - tainability is not influenced by DIS, with a non-significant coefficient of \u0000 0.020 (p = 0.251). This indicates that in SMEs, digital innovation strategies no moderating effect on how AI technologies contribute to economic sustainability, possibly due to competing priorities or the limited integration of digital strategies with economic goals. The nega - tive moderating effect of DIS on the relationship between AITS and environmental sustainability is more pronounced, with a coefficient of \u0000 0.173 (p < 0.001), suggesting that even in larger organizations, digital strategies may not always align well with environmental goals. For so - cial sustainability, the negative moderating effect of DIS is strongest, with a coefficient of \u0000 0.219 (p < 0.001), reflecting the challenges SMEs face in using digital strategies to enhance social impacts. This could result from competing priorities, where the focus on digital trans - formation may divert resources and attention from social responsibility initiatives. For the total sample of MSMEs, the results largely mirror the trends observed in SMEs. The moderating effect of DIS on the relationship between AITS and economic sustainability is negligible and non- significant, with a coefficient of \u0000 0.000 (p = 0.492), indicating that DIS does not influence this relationship at the aggregate level. However, the moderating effect of DIS on the relationship between AITS and environmental sustainability remains negative and significant, with a coefficient of \u0000 0.152 (p < 0.001), reaffirming the challenges firms face in leveraging digital strategies to achieve environmental goals. The moderating effect of DIS on the relationship between AITS and social sustainability is the strongest, with a coefficient of \u0000 0.207 (p < 0.001), highlighting the persistent difficulties firms experience in integrating digital strategies with efforts to enhance social responsibility. The differences in these moderating effects by organizational size can be attributed to varying capacities and strategic priorities. Micro - firms, with their limited financial and human resources, often struggle to effectively integrate DIS with AI technologies for achieving sustain - ability goals, leading to positive effects on economic sustainability but negative effects on environmental and social sustainability. SMEs, despite having more resources than microfirms, may still face mis - alignments between digital strategies and sustainability objectives, particularly in the environmental and social dimensions. The complexity of implementing a digital innovation strategy alongside AI technologies further adds to these challenges, as firms of all sizes must navigate resource constraints, expertise gaps, and strategic trade-offs. These findings emphasize the importance of aligning digital strategies with broader sustainability goals to maximize the potential of AI technologies in both microfirms and SMEs. 5. Conclusions 5.1.

Theoretical implications This research examined the impact of the interaction between eco - nomic innovation, AI-based technological systems and social and envi - ronmental innovation upon firm environmental, economic and social sustainability. To this end, we tested four hypotheses based on a PLS- SEM econometric method and a sample of 12,326 small and middle- size European firms. The main analysis objectives have been to test: 1) whether economic innovation explains environmental and social inno - vation; 2) whether AI-based technological systems and social and environmental innovation mediate the relationship between economic innovation and environmental, economic and social sustainability, 3) as well as tackling the moderating role of digital innovation strategy in the relationship between AI-based technological systems and environ - mental, economic and social sustainability. Despite the high expectations that have been generated, there is currently very little research analysing the social, economic and envi - ronmental sustainability pathways in firms as a result of the interaction between AI use and different types of innovation. Addressing this research gap is crucial because ecological and socio-environmental economics have long warned about the limitations and inadequacies of our responses to the climate emergency and social inequality. Advancing in practices of investment in environmental assets, cir - cular economy, and green growth, in addition to implementing social responsibility actions with stakeholders, seems to be an important pathway towards social and environmental sustainability, thus con - firming hypotheses. For this, firms have a powerful technological and innovative. This study enhances our theoretical understanding of sustainability pathways by integrating economic innovation, AI-based technological systems, and digital innovation strategies within a comprehensive framework. By examining these relationships in the context of European microfirms and SMEs, the study confirms that economic innovation serves as a key driver in the adoption of AI technologies and achieving sustainability outcomes, in line with the resource-based view ( Barney, 1991, 1996, 2001 ) and innovation diffusion theories ( Rogers, 2003 ). The segmentation by organisational size highlights the distinct roles that firm size plays in moderating the effectiveness of innovation strategies, enhancing theoretical understanding of how organisational capabilities influence sustainability outcomes. These findings build on the triple bottom line framework ( Elkington, 1997 ), demonstrating the intercon - nectedness of economic, environmental, and social innovations towards achieving sustainable development. The study also extends the discourse on digital transformation by revealing that while digital innovation strategies can support sustain - ability in some dimensions, they may also create strategic mis - alignments — particularly for smaller firms with limited resources. This nuanced finding challenges the assumption that digitalization and sus - tainability reinforce each other unconditionally. Instead, it highlights that when digital strategies place excessive emphasis on automation and control, they may marginalise ecological and social concerns, leading to potential trade-offs. This research contributes to the discourse on stra - tegic alignment, emphasising the need for a more flexible and context- J. Torrent-Sellens et al.

{"page_content": "sensitive approach to integrating digital transformation and sustain - ability ( Porter & Kramer, 2011 ). Additionally, the findings contribute to theoretical models on technology adoption, emphasising the differing impacts of AI-based software and hardware components on sustain - ability, which have been underexplored in prior literature ( Brynjolfsson & McAfee, 2014 ). 5.2. Practical implications Obtaining these sustainability pathways is important because they provide insights into firms ’ progression towards digital and socio- environmental transitions, and identify heterogeneous predictor fac - tors in terms of innovation and AI usage. Our results suggest that differentiated business strategies and public innovation and digital transition policies are needed depending on the type of sustainability and firm size ( Díaz-Chao et al., 2021; Paiho et al., 2023 ). A key impli - cation in this context is the need for firms to activate the dynamic ca - pabilities required to leverage digital transition for the benefit of sustainability ( Díaz-Chao et al., 2021 ). External assistance is particularly valuable in this regard, especially for smaller firms. In the specific case of AI, given its still limited use, it seems evident that support policies and strategies for training people and for the self-selection of firms should be accelerated ( Chhillar & Aguilera, 2022 ). This research offers practical insights to foster sustainability in microfirms and SMEs. For microfirms, economic innovation emerges as driver of AI adoption and sustainability, highlighting the importance of fostering innovation in products, processes, and business models. Microfirms should prioritize targeted investments in innovation to un - lock the potential of AI-based technologies ( Babina et al., 2024 ). How - ever, the findings also reveal that digital innovation strategies may negatively moderate the relationship between AI adoption and envi - ronmental or social sustainability. This suggests that microfirms need to carefully align digital strategies with resource capabilities to avoid po - tential trade-offs. Policymakers can support this alignment by providing tailored interventions, such as financial subsidies, capacity-building programs, and digital training initiatives designed specifically for microfirms. For SMEs, the results indicate that digital innovation strategies can enhance sustainability dimensions when effectively integrated with technological adoption. SMEs should focus on aligning digital trans - formation initiatives with broader sustainability goals, such as circular economy practices and social responsibility efforts, to maximize the benefits of AI technologies. Moreover, the findings emphasize the importance of strategic investments in both AI-based hardware and software, as these technologies significantly contribute to economic and environmental sustainability. Policymakers should support these efforts by fostering collaborative platforms that enable knowledge sharing, thereby reducing the barriers SMEs face in implementing advanced digital technologies. These measures are particularly critical as SMEs play a key role in driving sustainable development across Europe. 5.3. Limitations Despite the positive findings, the limitations of this research require a cautious interpretation of our conclusions to avoid technological sol - utionism ( Naud ´e, 2021 ). First, the reliance on self-reported data from the Flash Euro - barometer 486 may introduce response bias, as firms may overstate their engagement in innovation and sustainability practices. This limitation aligns with concerns raised in prior survey-based research ( Podsakoff et al., 2024 ). Future studies should consider supplementing survey data with objective performance metrics, such as firm-level financial or environmental performance indicators, to validate the results. Second, the cross-sectional nature of the study limits the ability to infer causality between variables. Longitudinal studies could provide a more compre - hensive understanding of how relationships between economic inno - vation, digital strategies, and sustainability evolve over time ( Martínez-Caro et al., 2020 ). Additionally, while the study captures differences between micro - firms and SMEs, it does not account for sector-specific variations in innovation and sustainability practices, which may influence the generalizability of the findings. Future research could explore how industry-specific factors, such as regulatory environments or market competition, impact the adoption of AI technologies and sustainability outcomes ( Heimberger et al., 2024 ). Lastly, the study notes that the moderating effects of digital innovation strategies, while significant, are relatively small in magnitude. This suggests the need for further inves - tigation into contextual factors, such as organizational culture, leader - ship, or external pressures that may influence the effectiveness of these strategies. Addressing these limitations would provide deeper insights into the complex dynamics of digital transformation and sustainability in European firms. 5.4. Conclusion The findings of this study challenge the prevailing assumption of a seamless complementarity between the digital and socio-environmental transitions, exposing a substitution effect that disrupts the expected synergies of the twin transition. The results reveal that Digital innova - tion strategy negatively moderates the relationship between AI-based technological systems adoption and environmental and social sustain - ability.

The results reveal that Digital innova - tion strategy negatively moderates the relationship between AI-based technological systems adoption and environmental and social sustain - ability. This contradiction underscores that when digitalization and sustainability are strategically planned together under a rigid frame - work, their integration does not necessarily reinforce but may, instead, weaken one another. While AI adoption contributes positively to sustainability di - mensions, the introduction of a structured digital strategy seems to diminish these benefits in MSMEs, particularly in relation to environ - mental and social sustainability. This finding aligns with the idea that the twin transition is not as twin as often portrayed; rather than pro - gressing hand in hand, the two transitions may work at cross-purposes depending on strategic and managerial decisions. The evidence sug - gests that digital strategies, when overly focused on automation and control, may prioritize efficiency and competitiveness over ecological and social concerns, ultimately undermining sustainability goals. The findings of this study question whether the so-called twin tran - sition is truly a convergence of digital and socio-environmental trans - formations or, instead, a \"meeting of strangers,\" where digitalization and sustainability follow divergent or even conflicting paths.

Implications of electrification, digitalization, and automation on truck and taxi drivers Jindan Gong a, *, Maria Xylia a, Claudia Strambo a, Bj ¨orn Nykvist a, Sirin Celik b a Stockholm Environment Institute (SEI), Box 24218, 104 51, Stockholm, Sweden b Swedish Transport Workers ’ Union, Box 714, 101 33, Stockholm, Sweden ARTICLE INFO Keywords: Low-carbon transport Quality of working life Taxi drivers Truck drivers Just transition Transport workers ABSTRACT Electrification, digitalization and automation are three trends driving the low-carbon transition of the transport sector. For the transition to be just, it is essential to ensure that those affected by these trends view the changes they bring as acceptable and fair. Transport policy development, however, mostly remains expert-driven. To explore just transitions in the context of transport electrification, digitalization and automation, we use Sweden as a case to analyse how taxi and truck drivers perceive the implications of these trends on six aspects of their quality of working life: skill requirements, work organization, job security, identity, safety and health. We also explore how these perceptions vary across dimensions of age, gender and geography. We found several perceived challenges related to skill requirements and identity, though drivers also see the potential for the trends to improve their work environment, safety and performance. However, these potential benefits are not taken for granted. The perceived implications may also raise potential distributional, procedural and recognition in - justices, for instance regarding costs of reskilling, drivers ’ autonomy and the recognition of drivers ’ knowledge. We conclude that the technologies can have both positive and negative implications, and it is rather institutional arrangements, social processes, and broader societal and industrial shifts that cause transport workers to question their future in this sector. Incorporating drivers ’ insights into decision-making can enhance the drivers ’ quality of working life and wellbeing while preserving their dignity. 1. Introduction Three emerging trends are expected to drive the low-carbon transi - tion of the transport sector: electrification, digitalization and automa - tion [ 1, 2 ]. These trends are not only linked to the introduction of new technologies but also to the process of societal embedding, through which society is reshaped to adapt to and adopt the new technologies [ 3 ]. As instances of socio-structural change, low-carbon transitions are known to be contested; they have the potential to be perceived as unjust, become politicized, and deepen and exacerbate social divisions [ 4 – 6 ]. Socio-economic trends, including technological developments and climate change, have profound impacts on worker ’ s day-to-day experi - ences [ 7 ]. Although a fair distribution of positive and negative impacts is key for a just transition, it is not sufficient. A just transition needs to be analysed across all three dimensions of justice: distributional justice, that is, the distribution of benefits, costs and risks of the transition across society; procedural justice, which refers to participation in decision-making processes; and recognition justice, that is, equal respect for all, including the acknowledgment of individuality, social context and history [ 8, 9 ]. A key aspect here too is the inclusion of multiple types of knowledge in shaping transitions [ 10 ]. Different social groups also have different voices when shaping the policies and processes that govern these emerging trends. The way these voices are recognized and included determines the justness and equity of low-carbon transitions [ 5 ]. The literature on sustainability transitions has so far paid little attention to the role of workers in these transitions [ 11 ]. Understanding the implications of electrification, digitalization and automation for transport workers is essential to ensure that those impacted by these changes view them as acceptable and fair, that is, for the transition to be just. The concept of just transition has been used by labour organizations to highlight the need for complementing environmental and climate action with social safeguards, letting the interests of workers guide sustainable transitions and involving workers in designing the transition [ 12 ]. In the low-carbon transition of transport in Sweden, our case study, there is, however, a disconnection between unions ’ climate policy * Corresponding author. E-mail address: jindan.gong@sei.org (J.

{"page_content": "developments at the national level and the engagement of members [ 13 ]. Additionally, transport planning and policy development remains mostly expert-driven [ 14 ]. For a just transition, in this sense, there is a need to better understand and recognize transport workers’ concerns and aspirations. To explore just transitions in the context of transport electrification, digitalization and automation, this paper draws on the literature on the quality of working life, which studies workers’ satisfaction with their jobs [ 15 ], including objective and subjective aspects [ 16 ]. Grounded in this literature, the research centres on six overarching categories, addressing both objective and subjective elements of working life. These include skill requirements, work organization, job security, identity, safety and health [ 7, 15 ]. It is important to note that workers are not a homogenous group and that variables such as gender, age and geogra - phy can influence their wellbeing at work in different ways [ 17, 18 ]. In this context, we aim to address the identified knowledge gap by investigating the implications of electrification, digitalization and automation for truck and taxi drivers, and assessing how these vary by gender, age and geography. To recognize the need for including workers’ own evaluations of their job [ 19 ], we use qualitative methods, including semi-structured interviews with drivers and a workshop with union representatives, to help identify patterns of common perceptions of the transition’s implications for transport workers. We use Sweden as a case study due to its long-standing leadership in climate policy [ 20 ] which today is expressed in its ambition of becoming the world’s first fossil-free welfare society [ 21 ]. There is also a strong interest among trade unions in Sweden to engage proactively on decarbonization [ 22, 23 ]. In addition, the latest Swedish Climate Action Plan – a white paper that the Swedish Government needs to present one year after an election according to the Swedish climate law (SFS 2017:720) – firmly recognizes justice and acceptance as one of the “three fundamental conditions laying the groundwork the current climate policy” [ 21, p. 10]. The Swedish Climate Policy Council has highlighted, however, that the plan lacks analysis of climate policy impacts on different groups in society, as well as concrete policy mea - sures to achieve a just transition [ 25 ]. While Swedish climate policy in practice has very limited considerations of justice, the action plan clearly links climate ambition with a continued progressive social pol - icy, motivating the selection of Sweden as a case that balances climate action and justice considerations. In this paper, we aim to explore the following questions. RQ1. How do transport workers perceive the impact of electrification, digitalization and automation on their working life? RQ2. How do the perceived impacts of electrification, digitalization and automation on transport workers vary across gender, age and geography? RQ3. What kind of tensions might arise between current commercial passenger and goods transport systems and the developments in elec - trification, digitalization and automation? Through these questions, we aim to connect the literature on the low- carbon transition in the transport sector with that on the quality of working life and just transitions. Indeed, studies on the implications of decarbonization for workers have so far focused on employment levels [ 26, 27 ] rather than quality of working life, and they have mostly concentrated on the fossil fuel industry e.g. [ 28, 29 ]. Moreover, the so - cial and cultural impacts of the transition, for instance the way in which people will renegotiate intangible values, such as social and cultural identities, have also received less attention, with the exception of the coal industry [ 30 ]. The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 offers background and summarizes the relevant literature. Section 3 describes the methods and the analytical approach used in our study. Section 4 presents the results on the perceived significant implications from the decarbonization trends on transport workers, followed by a discussion in Section 5. Finally, Section 6 provides policy recommendations and concluding remarks. 2. Background Here, we explore the Swedish case in more detail to provide richer context for the just transition in the country’s transport sector. We also take stock of the literatures on the quality of working life, the implica - tions of low-carbon transitions on transport workers, and on just tran - sitions for transport workers. 2.1. Sweden’s transition to a fossil-free welfare society We take Sweden as our case due to its ambition of becoming the world’s first fossil-free welfare society, a narrative and political climate goal initiated in 2017 by the former Social Democrat-led government together with the Swedish Green Party. This ambition puts focus on how the whole of Swedish society, across parts of society, economic sectors and industry forming the economic base for a modern welfare state, all must contribute in order to reach Swedish climate goals [", "metadata": {"producer": "Acrobat Distiller 8.1.0 (Windows)", "creator": "Elsevier", "creationdate": "2025-04-26T09:28:56+00:00", "crossmarkdomains[1]": "elsevier.com", "crossmarkmajorversiondate": "2010-04-23", "creationdate--text": "26th April 2025", "elsevierwebpdfspecifications": "7.0.1", "robots": "noindex", "moddate": "2025-04-26T10:05:25+00:00", "author": "Jindan Gong", "doi": "10.1016/j.techsoc.2025.102816", "title": "What happened to the driver?

Sweden’s transition to a fossil-free welfare society We take Sweden as our case due to its ambition of becoming the world’s first fossil-free welfare society, a narrative and political climate goal initiated in 2017 by the former Social Democrat-led government together with the Swedish Green Party. This ambition puts focus on how the whole of Swedish society, across parts of society, economic sectors and industry forming the economic base for a modern welfare state, all must contribute in order to reach Swedish climate goals [ 31 ]. This discourse remains core to the framing of the standing inquiry “Fossil Free Sweden” (Dir 2016:66/2020:50), tasked with coordinating and supporting Swedish industry in the transition to net zero emissions in line with the Swedish climate goals. The mandate and framing to foster a fossil-free welfare society remains in place under the current right wing coalition government. Swedish trade unions engage proactively on decarbonization [ 22, 23 ], aligning with industrial actors on the necessity of transitioning to fossil-free technologies [ 32 ]. The climate agenda has thus been adopted by both parties of the Swedish labour market – trade unions and employer organizations – reflecting their long-standing tradition of enabling stable economic progress for both companies and workers through collective bargaining. However, the transition is not without challenges for workers, particularly in the Swedish transport sector, where decarbonization pathways remain uncertain. This ambiguity can give rise to conflicts, underscoring the need for a justice-focused approach to ensure fair outcomes for all stakeholders [ 33 ]. Recent instances include the dispute between the automotive company Tesla and the Swedish Metal Workers’ Union in the winter of 2023–2024, where Tesla is declining to enter into a collective agreement with the union [ 34 ]. Additionally, there has been some opposition from companies introducing digitalization in the Swedish taxi industry regarding collective agreements pertaining to working conditions [ 35 ]. The literature shows that contestation and justice are critical in the energy transition, including in Sweden [ 36 ], as competing justice claims, priorities and framings inherently shape transitional processes [ 37 ]. Hence, a Swedish case study delving into the justice implications regarding the quality of working life for professional drivers, as outlined in this research, offers important insights. These insights address the contemporary challenges associated with tran - sitioning to a low-carbon transport system amid the accelerating elec - trification, digitalization and automation trends, all while preserving essential aspects of a welfare society. Moreover, the Swedish case pro - vides a model for understanding similar dynamics in other welfare-oriented economies facing similar challenges in balancing ambitious climate goals with the protection of labour rights and quality of life for workers. By examining Sweden’s transition, this research aims to contribute generalizable insights into how other nations might address the justice-related dimensions of energy transitions within their own socio-economic and institutional contexts. Given that the transport sector’s transition is partly governed at the EU level, insights from Sweden’s approach can offer valuable lessons for other EU countries aligning national efforts with broader EU climate and transport goals and directives.

{"page_content": "2.2. Quality of working life and drivers’ challenges This paper draws on the literature about the quality of working life, which studies the relationship between key dimensions of working life and workers’ wellbeing [ 38, 39 ]. As the concept of job quality is multi - dimensional in nature [ 40, 41 ], there is neither a consensus on what exactly quality of working life entails, nor ready-made indicators and methods to assess it [ 15 ]. Broadly, the concept of “quality of working life” refers to “an overall state of satisfaction that includes objective aspects of material wellbeing, satisfactory relationships with the phys - ical and social environment, and objectively perceived health; and subjective aspects of physical, psychological and social wellbeing” [ 42, p. 618]. Building on this specific definition as well as the broader literature, the present study focuses on six overarching categories, covering objective and subjective aspects of working life: skill re - quirements, work organization, job security, identity, safety and health [ 7, 15 ]. One area of research in this field is the implications of structural changes such as globalization, climate change and the emergence of new technologies, contracts and labour relations’ frameworks on job quality [ 7, 43, 44 ]. The present study contributes to existing literature by exploring perceived impacts of electrification, digitalization and auto - mation – key structural trends reshaping the transport sector – on the quality of working life in Sweden. Truck and taxi drivers today face various challenges with regards to their job quality. The main challenges relevant in the Nordic context are summarized in Table 1, grouped into the aforementioned six categories. These challenges are naturally interconnected. Stress is a major health concern for drivers, which can be attributed to the fast-paced work environment, high workload and considerable time pressure, which may in turn lead to other health issues and traffic safety risks [ 47 ]. In addition to stress, insufficient sleep and work monotony may cause drivers to resort to secondary task engagement, further height - ening traffic safety risks [ 47, 50 ]. For truck drivers, the strict Hours-of-Service (HoS) regulations and the unpredictability of other road users’ behaviour, are raised as particular stressors which may contribute to increased pressure to work longer days, and sometimes, violate the HoS regulations [ 48 ]. In addi - tion to stress related to time pressures, taxi drivers face the economic stress of earning a living wage, as many drivers work on commission-based salaries. This stress can be attributed to the sector’s competitive nature and imposed salary structures. For example, in some cases, contracts limit compensation only to working hours when a pas - senger is present in the vehicle, i.e. idle time is not included. Faced with these stressors, taxi drivers may feel compelled to exceed speed limits or violate working hour regulations – exposing themselves and others to potential safety risks [ 47 ]. The low social regard for drivers relates to both salary structures and the complexities of the professions. The deregulation of the Swedish taxi industry led to an over-establishment of taxies in larger cities and increased competition [ 47 ]. This weakened collective agreements, resulting in salary structures where taxi drivers are only compensated when they have passengers [ 47 ]. Low social regard for truck drivers stems from public unawareness of the job’s advanced elements, such as vehicle manoeuvring and traffic navigation, as well as a lack of under - standing of the profession’s societal importance [ 49 ]. 2.3. The transition to low-carbon transport Previous research on vehicle electrification has often focused on techno-economic aspects and risks overlooking social implications. Studies on electric vehicle adoption among professional drivers, for example, assume that drivers of electric vehicles receive the same sal - aries as drivers of non-electric vehicles, and that they charge their cars only during mandated breaks [ 51, 52 ]. Electric taxi charging strategies and charging station availability have been studied, but without considering potential travel pattern shifts [ 53, 54 ]. There are, however, indications that charging, queuing and detouring to reach available charging points do impact driving time, salaries and regulation compliance for professional drivers [ 55, 56 ]. In relation to digitalization and automation, the literature highlights concerns about transport workers becoming bystanders in the deploy - ment of the technologies [ 57–59 ]. For example, digital platforms and algorithmic management often prioritize customer demands, dis - regarding regulations and professional drivers’ wellbeing [60,61].

There are, however, indications that charging, queuing and detouring to reach available charging points do impact driving time, salaries and regulation compliance for professional drivers [ 55, 56 ]. In relation to digitalization and automation, the literature highlights concerns about transport workers becoming bystanders in the deploy - ment of the technologies [ 57–59 ]. For example, digital platforms and algorithmic management often prioritize customer demands, dis - regarding regulations and professional drivers’ wellbeing [60,61].

At the same time, there are ongoing EU-level discussions to improve platform workers’ conditions and rights, and to mitigate challenges for transport workers due to digitalization and automation [ 63, 64 ]. 2.4. Just transitions for transport workers The academic literature has so far paid little attention to just tran - sitions for transport workers, with research instead focusing on equity concerns in the transition for transport users, e.g. [ 65, 66 ]. There are some exceptions, however. For instance, Sunio [ 37 ] explores the im - plications of the transport transition on informal motorcycle taxis and public transport drivers in the Philippines. They pinpoint injustices resulting from the transition, such as potential job displacement, con - centration of the benefits for existing incumbents, and safety risks. Silva et al. [ 67 ] explore how American Midwest automobile workers and communities envision the electric vehicle transition. They identify contrasting views between actors, where managers and communities are optimistic about economic opportunities, while autoworkers are scep - tical that their past contributions and knowledge will be recognized in the transition. Another example is Pichler et al. [ 68 ], who studied the role of workers and unions in the transformation of the Austrian auto - motive industry and identified key factors that can support the sector’s transformation, including bolstering workers’ confidence in their qual - ifications and expertise, and shaping state policies and framework conditions. Two additional factors in this work relate to the position of unions in the broader society: adopting a social unionism-based approach (i.e. going beyond defending jobs and instead criticizing given modes of production), developing alternatives that benefit society Table 1 Current challenges faced by truck and taxi drivers in the Nordics.

{"page_content": "overall, and fostering alliances with environmental movements. As fairness considerations have gained prominence in climate- related national and international policy debates, transport unions have highlighted their just transition agenda and pointed to policies and measures that can support transport workers amid the sector’s transi - tion. Key priorities include the creation of decent and sustainable green jobs, and support for workers to navigate the transition through reactive labour market policies, effective social protection systems and reskilling and upskilling programs. The latter is particularly important as the sector suffers from skills and labour shortages. They also highlight the importance of transport workers’ conditions, labour’s involvement in just transition-related decision-making, and the fact that existing just transition mechanisms in Europe are not applicable to the transport sector [ 69, 70 ]. By gathering first hand perspectives from those directly affected, this study highlights nuanced issues that may not be captured by broader policy discussions. 3. Methods Our analytical approach combined qualitative content analysis with thematic analysis to interpret textual data. Both methods support the identification and categorization of data excerpts (codes) to describe patterns (themes) and, more broadly, to describe phenomena [ 71 ]. This combination, as demonstrated by Brough et al. [ 72 ], leverages the flexibility of both qualitative content analysis and thematic analysis in research design [ 73, 74 ] and utilizes their similar analytical techniques [ 71 ]. We further extended our approach by using a hybrid process of deductive and inductive coding for theme development, benefitting from the complementary strengths these modalities have, as demon - strated separately for qualitative content analysis and thematic analysis in prior research [ 75, 76 ]. Our study began with a deductive content analysis, followed by an inductive thematic analysis to examine Swedish transport workers’ perceptions of electrification, digitalization and automation. Inspired by the work of Sovacool et al. [ 77 ], we then applied a justice lens through deductive content analysis to critically examine how the identified themes intersect with broader socio-political, economic and environmental concerns, providing a nuanced understanding of justice issues in transport transitions. Our main method of gathering data was semi-structured interviews. To increase confidence in the validity of the results, we applied methods triangulation, verifying consistency of findings across all the employed data collection methods [ 78 ]. A workshop was conducted with trade union representatives as a complementary data source. Insights from the workshop were used to test the consistency with interview findings, and to capture additional dimensions of the explored trends’ impacts on transport workers. 3.1. Data collection 3.1.1. Interviews We conducted semi-structured interviews focusing on understanding truck and taxi drivers’ views on the transport-related technological and system changes resulting from three major trends of decarbonization in the transport sector: electrification, digitalization and automation. In total, 20 interviews were conducted between October 2022 and February 2023 with taxi and truck drivers. Each interview was approximately 1 h long. Purposeful sampling was used to recruit a diverse set of participants and capture a broad range of experiences, covering different ages, genders and urban or rural geographies, as well as union membership status (member or not). In this study, we explore gender as the socially constructed behaviours and identities of women and men, leaving the full portrayal of gender out of the scope of study. The majority of the participants were recruited with the help of the Swedish Transport Workers’ Union. Participants were provided with written information about the study, data collection and management, and asked for their informed consent. The collected data were anony - mized. The consent process adhered to a pre-approved plan by the Swedish Ethical Review Authority. Table 2 summarizes the de - mographics of the interview participants. In general, our sample comprised an even representation of drivers below and above the average age, and an even representation of male and female drivers. The sample entails a higher representations of truck drivers compared to taxi drivers, and of drivers operating in urban areas compared to rural areas. A set of guiding questions were designed with the feedback from the Swedish Transport Workers’ Union to ensure the practical relevance of the research. They were split into three main sections, exploring: 1) what drivers value about their job, 2) what they view as potential benefits and drawbacks of electrification, 3) what they view as potential benefits and drawbacks of digitalization and automation. The questions, provided as part of the interview guide in Table A1 ( Appendix A ), focused on the impacts of the three decarbonization trends on skill re - quirements, work organization, job security, identity, safety and health. The interview guide also included preliminary questions about partici - pants’ familiarity with electrification, digitalization and automation, along with prompts on possible trend developments, as prior knowledge or experience with these trends was not a recruitment criterion. 3.1.2.

Workshop An online workshop with union representatives was conducted on March 21, 2023. The workshop engaged 14 participants in their capacity as trade union representatives and included 11 men and 3 women from the Swedish Transport Workers’ Union, spanning over nine Swedish cities. Again, the consent process adhered to the pre-approved plan by the Swedish Ethical Review Authority. Apart from written information about the study, data collection and management, workshop partici - pants were informed about the risks and benefits of their participation and asked for verbal permission to use the workshop findings for research purposes. The collected information were anonymized. The workshop began with a presentation of the decarbonization trends, which enhanced the participants’ background knowledge but avoided specific insights on challenges or impacts on transport workers, to avoid steering the discussion. Subsequent discussions focused on the participants’ concerns around the decarbonization trends; on associated risks and benefits, as well as on just transition measures related to the trends. In a second stage of the workshop, preliminary insights from the interviews were presented to stimulate discussions on potential impacts. 3.2. Data analysis All interviews were recorded and transcribed verbatim prior to the analysis. Transcriptions were uploaded in MaxQDA 2020, a computer- assisted qualitative data analysis software. Deductive content analysis was conducted using a structured categorization matrix developed based on the six broad categories of the quality of working life. Guided by these categories, themes were then identified by applying an inductive the - matic analysis. Line-by-line open coding was first used to inductively derive a set of discrete excerpts from the transcriptions. The codes that emerged were organized and grouped into sub-themes, and then into main themes under the broader theory-induced categories of perceived Table 2 Overview of interviewed drivers.

{"page_content": "impacts. Only the aspects that fit the matrix of analysis were used when coding the qualitative data [ 74 ]. Finally, to identify tensions, the resulting themes and sub-themes were analysed through a deductive content analysis based on the three tenets of justice [ 8, 9 ]: distributional justice, procedural justice and recognition justice. Interviews were conducted and analysed continuously to ensure that saturation had been reached. All interviews but one were carried out by the same person (the first author), who also subsequently did the coding. As part of the methods triangulation, the workshop complemented our semi-structured interview analysis of transport workers’ perceived im - pacts of the decarbonization trends. The data analysis was conducted by multiple authors. 3.3. Limitations We acknowledge several limitations. We used purposeful sampling to capture insights from several transport worker categories, across different ages and gender. However, budget and time constraints, as well as difficulties in recruiting respondents from all the groups listed in Table 2, led to an incomplete sample for some categories. For example, taxi drivers operating in rural areas, and non-unionized transport workers, were under-represented in the study. As shown in the following sections, however, our identified main themes of drivers’ perceptions of the low-carbon transition trends were common across driver categories. Therefore, we expect that the results are still relevant even for under- represented groups. The smaller sample of female truck drivers might have influenced the analysis on gender-related impacts. Besides, our sampling strategy followed a binary perspective of gender, thus pre - venting findings related to other gender expressions. A workshop with trade union representatives was held to comple - ment and test the findings from the individual interviews. Participants of this workshop, however, solely represented the Swedish Transport Workers’ Union, meaning the workshop did not include inputs from other relevant trade unions such as the Union for Service and Commu - nications Employees (SEKO). Our study was also carried out in collaboration with the Swedish Transport Workers’ Union. Their involvement was by design in the research project for which they are a partner and was further manifested through co-authorship of this paper. This collaboration facilitated the access to a diverse set of interview participants on sensitive issues and enabled in-depth interviews and purposeful sampling of informants across age, gender and geography that would not have been possible otherwise. The union provided feedback on the interview question design and data collection, which may have contributed to shaping the research findings. To reduce the risk of bias, we grounded the guiding interview questions in existing literature on transport decarbonization trends and their effects on transport workers. Finally, our study focused on potential impacts perceived by taxi and truck drivers (including delivery truck drivers), lacking further seg - mentation of different transport worker types, such as public transport drivers, cycling cargo workers, and gig-economy workers. We attempted to target the latter for the recruitment of non-unionized interview par - ticipants through alternative channels, such as social media. These ef - forts were however unsuccessful, further demonstrating the value of the collaboration with the Swedish Transport Workers’ Union in this study. 4. Results and analysis 4.1. Perceived implications of electrification, digitalization and automation on drivers’ quality of working life Here, we present the refined results of the analysis and outline the aggregated main themes regarding how drivers perceive the low-carbon transition trends’ implications on their working life. These themes of perceived implications are grouped into the six broad categories of working life, as specified in section 2.2. The presentation of main themes is complemented with individual relevant insights from interview par - ticipants and trade union representatives, to provide additional nuance. An overview of the main themes of perceived implications and how they are constructed by respective sub-themes and codes is presented in Table B1 ( Appendix B ). 4.1.1. Skill requirements On the one hand, drivers recognized that existing skill requirements, such as having a driver’s licence, will remain relevant even in light of the three trends discussed (electrification, automation and digitalization). In some cases, drivers’ tasks might even become easier. One interviewee further noted that the functionality of vehicles already varies signifi - cantly, therefore workers already adapt to new operations when switching vehicles. On the other hand, there is a strong anticipation of a shift away from skills related to active driving and mechanical knowledge, and towards increased proficiency in information technologies (IT), and electric vehicle maintenance and operation, including understanding how fac - tors like terrain, weather and driving style impact a vehicle’s range. As one interviewee put it: “In terms of competence, it becomes an addi - tional factor when hiring someone – how to charge and what do you do if the car does not charge or if something does not work properly.” The interviewees saw that the regular licence renewal trainings in place pose a natural channel to introducing programs", "metadata": {"producer": "Acrobat Distiller 8.1.0 (Windows)", "creator": "Elsevier", "creationdate": "2025-04-26T09:28:56+00:00", "crossmarkdomains[1]": "elsevier.com", "crossmarkmajorversiondate": "2010-04-23", "creationdate--text": "26th April 2025", "elsevierwebpdfspecifications": "7.0.1", "robots": "noindex", "moddate": "2025-04-26T10:05:25+00:00", "author": "Jindan Gong", "doi": "10.1016/j.techsoc.2025.102816", "title": "What happened to the driver?

In relation to the profession’s social prestige, one interviewee anticipated that new skill requirements could make obtaining a driver’s licence more difficult, which could in turn heighten the social prestige of the profession and elevate the sense of pride in being a driver. One driver was concerned, for example, that changing skill requirements may attract fewer people to the profession. On the other hand, another interviewee saw an opportunity for upskilling towards a steward role, i. e. someone who ensures that the systems work effectively. 4.1.2. Work organization In particular, interviewed truck drivers saw advantages in the emerging trends, from the reduction of harmful exhaust gases with battery electric vehicles (BEVs), as this removes the need to turn off the engine when working outside of the vehicle, and improves the climate control of the cabin. The entire group of interviewees further recognized the potential for digital systems to assist with non-driving tasks and enhance overall performance. This includes simplifying administrative tasks, optimizing routes and organizing workdays, but also promoting energy-efficient driving techniques, thus improving the drivers’ fuel efficiency performance. However, there are concerns about potential discrepancies between transport planners’ expectations and how the daily work of completing transport trips unfolds in real life. Both trade union representatives and interviewees voiced that digital systems combined with transport planners’ tendency to overlook heavy traffic and other sources of delays, could result in unrealistic expectations, and put pressure on the drivers. As expressed by the drivers: “Sometimes the time windows [the time requirements that transport planners set on pick-ups, and deliveries and drop-offs] are impossible, so you’re already late when you start.” These concerns are compounded by interviewees’ perceived limita - tions of BEV flexibility, where consuming charging could lead to workday disruptions as it involves a need for stopping and taking the time to charge. Among the interviewees, there was a clear worry around the operational demands of charging, and the pressure to maintain a certain number of trips. These logistical challenges could potentially increase drivers’ working hours, and exacerbate their challenges with pressing schedules. As one interviewee put it: “[Charging] would take a few hours that need to be accounted for in the route calculations. […] It will not be possible to make the set timestamps. It will be troublesome to not be able to keep the time schedules. […] There is still a lot one should manage to do in one day.” The introduction of BEVs and their charging needs may further J.

{"page_content": "complicate route planning. If charging is tied to regulated breaks, the interviewees anticipated challenges in finding available charging points, particularly at preferred rest stops serving popular routes and offering good services. A few interviewed truck drivers emphasized the existing difficulties in finding suitable locations for rest and sleep, which elec - trification could exacerbate. Such logistical challenges were also recognized by a trade union representative who emphasized that drivers have little room to adjust where and when they take breaks. On the other hand, if charging needs fall outside of the regulated breaks, the broader group of interviewees and trade union representa - tives raised a need for clear rules on who will bear the costs for the time spent charging. As illustrated by one interviewee, sticking to overnight charging instead could limit workday disruptions and route planning challenges, but drivers were not certain about the batteries’ ability to complete a full day’s work on a single charge. Moreover, as electrification might increase logistical complexities, two interviewees foresaw that the transport of electrified goods might take longer. This creates potential conflicts with the current logistics system, where customers’ expectations are that goods are delivered the next day, and brings challenges for drivers in meeting customers’ ex - pectations. Despite these tensions, one trade union representative envisioned that electrification could be an opportunity: by imposing physical limitations on the amount of work that can be done in a day, companies and customers could be more accepting of logistics taking longer, in turn relieving pressure on drivers. 4.1.3. Job security Job security uncertainties are linked to perceptions of the employers’ ability to manage potentially higher costs associated with the intro - duction of electric vehicles (both upfront and operational costs), and self-driving vehicles. As one interviewee put it: “There is a fear. If we sit in the coffee room and talk about self-driving cars, that gets the con - versation going. In 15 years, we might not be needed.” The advent of remote vehicle operation is perceived as a similar threat: “If one person is controlling five trucks from home, then four drivers will lose their jobs.” Trade union representatives added that these worries around job loss are strengthened by seeing the progress of automation through pilot projects and other corporate initiatives. Moreover, there was a perception among interviewees and trade union representatives that it is in the interest of companies and cus - tomers to go for the cheapest option. As driver salaries usually represent the largest share of freight services’ total operational costs, minimizing the need for drivers is a way to keep the costs down. These worries are contrasted by a prevailing view that the human factor of the driving profession will always be needed. The interviewees’ concerns around job security are further exacer - bated by the challenges of meeting transport planners’ expectations of the new technologies. For truck drivers, the prospect of reduced load capacity due to heavy batteries and the scheduling adjustments for charging may impede the possible number of deliveries in a day. Taxi drivers expressed job security concerns in relation to charging infra - structure access, i.e. regarding how it affects their ability to undertake specific routes, or the way schedule changes can be communicated to managers. Particularly for commission-based taxi drivers, lost driving time directly translates to lost income. As one interviewee explained, “The taxi is like a casino: the less expenses and the more income the better it is.” 4.1.4. Identity Interviewed truck drivers expressed the worry that the trends under discussion may change truck driver craftsmanship – traditionally asso - ciated with mechanical engines, heavy machinery and navigating through complex driving conditions – and diminish the nature of the profession. Trade union representatives emphasized that truck driving craftsmanship is strongly associated with a sense of pride, which might decline with the onset of digitalization and automation. This may diminish drivers’ interest in the profession: “I love all kinds of machines and driving them is great fun. That is the main reason why I chose to become a truck driver.” Another interviewee expressed a sense of belittlement due to automation: “[You] might be criticized for having less knowledge than computers.” Similarly, a trade union representative noted that with digitalization and automation, the credit given to drivers for solving problems and completing trips could decline. Questions are further raised on how essential non-driving tasks might be overlooked by companies in the transition. The broader groups of interviewees stressed the importance of understanding customer- specific needs as a vital aspect of the profession, and doubts were expressed on the feasibility of automating away social interactions with customers. The taxi drivers we interviewed considered personal re - lationships with customers as an integral part of their profession.

{"page_content": "Another interviewee expressed a sense of belittlement due to automation: “[You] might be criticized for having less knowledge than computers.” Similarly, a trade union representative noted that with digitalization and automation, the credit given to drivers for solving problems and completing trips could decline. Questions are further raised on how essential non-driving tasks might be overlooked by companies in the transition. The broader groups of interviewees stressed the importance of understanding customer- specific needs as a vital aspect of the profession, and doubts were expressed on the feasibility of automating away social interactions with customers. The taxi drivers we interviewed considered personal re - lationships with customers as an integral part of their profession. This can be particularly relevant when meeting the needs of specific customer demographics, particularly the older or the sick customers, if, for example, the driver must stop to charge or if the heating system fails in cold weather. For the interviewed truck drivers, cargo handling skills and responsibilities, such as verifying and securing loads, loading and unloading, are earned from experience, and were considered far away from being solvable by automation. Trade union representatives further asked how the cargo handling responsibilities would be handled with driverless vehicles. Concerns also exist around occupational identity in relation to a more digitalized work organization. The drivers’ sense of autonomy and flexibility could be limited, and while digital systems can aid in planning and organizing workdays, there is an apprehension that they may not only impose stricter time schedules but also reduce the drivers’ sense of freedom to choose routes and rest locations. 4.1.5. Safety Drivers recognized that digital systems can aid vehicle manoeuvring and enhance traffic safety. The interviewed truck drivers, for example, saw Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) as valuable tools for navigating challenging road conditions and maintaining a heightened awareness of the surroundings. There were, at the same time, strong doubts around ADAS sensors’ ability to handle real-life traffic and road conditions, e.g. in challenging weather conditions: “Trucks today [with human drivers] already have problems staying on the road, so this is a big challenge for self-driving [vehicles].” Furthermore, digitalization was partly envisioned as a transition from more analogue dashboard interfaces to touch-based display screens, potentially leading to distractions, diverting driver’s attention from the traffic. Multiple signals from increasing numbers of digital systems could become stressors that elevate the risk of traffic accidents. Further safety risks were flagged in terms of an over-reliance on ADAS, leaving drivers under-stimulated with limited traffic awareness. As one interviewee put it: “[Driving] becomes a bit more mundane. You want to start doing something else when you are driving: you call a friend or listen to music. You get easily distracted with assistance systems.” Moreover, drivers expressed safety concerns about electrification, chiefly regarding crashes involving electric vehicles. The broader group of interviewees cited the dangers and challenges of extinguishing bat - tery fires and the potential risk of exposure to harmful gases. Trade union representatives raised further safety concerns in terms of drivers’ lack of knowledge, for instance not knowing if it is safe to approach a vehicle after an accident, and increased risks of being hacked when vehicles are digitalized. Additionally, concerns were raised about the risk of accidents from the quiet operation of electric engines, especially regarding individuals working in freight terminals, older customers and other individuals with hearing limitations. 4.1.6. Health Interviewees recognized that electrification can result in a quieter work environment (due to the quieter engine) and no exhaust gases – both are perceived as beneficial for workers’ health. “It is a lot of little J.

{"page_content": "things that in the end become a whole lot, ” as described by one inter - viewee. Additionally, digital systems can reduce drivers ’ cognitive load, allowing them to focus on important tasks. This was recognized by the interviewees as a way to reduce stress, leading to overall health im - provements and safety. Moreover, digitalization and automation were recognized as poten - tial aids in ensuring adherence to Hours-of-Service (HoS) regulations, alleviating stress in meeting delivery times without violating regula - tions, and contributing to positive health benefits: “ It is linked to com - mission work when you work so many hours. There are rules for resting periods, and rules for how much you can drive in a day. But today, when it is not digitalized, it opens up for a lot of cheating. ” BEV charging re - quirements present an opportunity for imposing more breaks during the drivers ’ workdays, and improving drivers ’ health, a trade union repre - sentative recommended. Another interviewee further saw the potential for remote operation in alleviating physical demands of prolonged sedentary work and foot pain from the pedals. However, challenges in meeting transport planners ’ expectations regarding digital systems, workday disruptions due to the lower flexi - bility of BEVs, and changing skill requirements were identified as stress- inducing factors and therefore could have negative health impacts on transport workers. According to one interviewee: “ Today, I know that if I have a full fuel tank, I can drive the whole route, but if I have to think about the temperature to know [whether I can make the full route] [ … ] it becomes a source of stress. ” 4.2. Perceptions of challenges for specific driver groups Our findings suggest that there was a perception of potentially higher job security risks for drivers in smaller transport companies, given the investment risks associated with technically advanced vehicles. Simi - larly, trade union representatives anticipated that drivers performing transport services that require more human interaction, and take place in more challenging traffic situations, such as cities, are likely to be replaced by automated vehicles at a later stage compared to other drivers. In the sections below, we explore differences depending on age, geography and gender in more detail. 4.2.1. Age There was a strong perception that older, more experienced drivers may face disadvantages in adapting to technological system changes, both culturally and practically. Older drivers were perceived as less open-minded and more likely to find technological advancements un - necessary and daunting. They were expected to struggle more to learn and adapt to electric, digitalized or automated vehicles, and to need more support. Moreover, it was noted that older drivers may face risks in terms of job market competitiveness: “ If you ’ re 30 and become unem - ployed, you won ’ t find it as difficult to find a new job as a 60 year-old who loses their job. ” On the other hand, although younger drivers might be more capable of adapting to new technologies, they were expected to be more affected by the transition in the sense that they are further away from retirement. One trade union representative also noted that younger drivers may be less hesitant to assert themselves and demand better working conditions, as they lack experience and deeper knowledge of what decent working conditions entail. 4.2.2. Geography Reliability and accessibility of infrastructure can be challenging for drivers operating in remote areas and on long-distance routes. Passing through areas with limited mobile network coverage and internet connection may affect vehicles that require constant connectivity. Concerns were also voiced regarding the charging infrastructure avail - ability in remote areas. Operating in northern Sweden, where temper - atures can go down to minus 30 ◦ C, was recognized to pose particular safety implications: a complete battery discharge can potentially disable heating and prevent doors from opening, requiring long response times for assistance and rescue services. 4.2.3. Gender Gender-specific challenges are less apparent, possibly due to the limited number of female interviewees and workshop participants. However, one of the female truck drivers we interviewed emphasized the need for proper sanitary services at charging stations and rest stops, especially for women. Meanwhile, trade union representatives noted that entrenched gender roles, like family commitments, can explain why men dominate the pool of drivers who have been in the profession for longer. But we found very limited evidence of gender-specific challenges related to the studied emerging trends. 4.3. Potential tensions from a justice lens Analysing transport workers ’ perceptions of electrification, auto - mation and digitalization on the quality of their working life raises a series of justice considerations. These span the three tenets of justice [ 8, 9 ], i.e. distributional justice (distribution of benefits, costs and risks), procedural justice (participation in decision-making processes), and recognition justice (equal respect for all) (see Table 3 ).

These span the three tenets of justice [ 8, 9 ], i.e. distributional justice (distribution of benefits, costs and risks), procedural justice (participation in decision-making processes), and recognition justice (equal respect for all) (see Table 3 ). From a distributional justice perspective, the transition to new technologies in the transport sector raises important questions about who will bear the costs of retraining and reskilling workers and who will have access to these opportunities. There is also uncertainty regarding whether the transition will expand or restrict access to employment within the sector, particularly as new skills are required. Other distri - butional questions include whether drivers will be compensated for time spent charging vehicles and how work regulations might adapt to ensure social protections and decent working conditions during and after the transition. Regional disparities in access to charging infrastructure, internet connectivity, and assistance and rescue services also shape the specific needs of transport workers, potentially creating uneven impacts across different areas. Age-related factors further influence job security and training needs, as older workers may face greater challenges in adapting to new technologies, while younger workers might more readily embrace these changes. Ultimately, training, compensation and regulatory frameworks will need to account for these diverse factors to promote a just transition for transport workers. From a procedural perspective, technological advancements and changes in business models also impact drivers ’ autonomy, as new systems might limit their decision-making power, shifting work towards a more regulated or monitored environment and potentially reducing drivers ’ sense of control and agency in their work, especially if they are not consulted in the development and implementation of these systems. From a recognition perspective, the data highlight potential tensions regarding new technologies and how the social systems around them acknowledge and value diverse aspects of drivers ’ roles and identities. Technological systems and decision-making processes can overlook non- driving tasks, such as cargo handling and building relationships with customers, which are integral to the job and contribute to both worker identity and pride. Similarly, drivers ’ experiential knowledge of driving challenges – such as navigating complex driving conditions, safety risks and time management – may not be fully accounted for in task man - agement systems and scheduling. As transport is typically a male-dominated sector, a key recognition justice question is whether the new technologies that are deployed, and their associated infrastructure and decision-making processes, accom - modate the specific needs of female workers. Addressing these recog - nition gaps is crucial to ensuring that the transition is not only efficient but also respectful and inclusive of all workers ’ roles, contributions and identities. J.

{"page_content": "5. Discussion In this paper, we have conducted interviews with truck and taxi drivers and a workshop with trade union representatives to further our knowledge on the potential impacts from electrification, automation and digitalization on the drivers’ quality of working life. In this section, we analyse and discuss the results through the lens of quality of working life and potential justice implications. 5.1. Perceived implications for drivers’ quality of working life 5.1.1. Skills, job security and identity In line with the findings of Christidis et al. [ 79 ], our study shows that drivers expect the emerging trends to influence future labour demand, necessitating new skills in IT and sustainable driving practices. Our study also indicates that there is a perception of older drivers being more pessimistic towards new technology and having slower adaptation speeds compared to younger, less experienced drivers, a result also found by Wallengren & Ottoson [ 49 ]. The perceived reluctance to embrace new technologies among older drivers and their lower adapt - ability may consequently influence their job security. That is, a mismatch in skills combined with these types of perceptions can lead to a displacement of older drivers into retirement [ 80 ], especially consid - ering that they tend to receive less training than their co-workers [ 81 ] and that reskilling opportunities accommodating their needs are perceived as uncertain [ 49 ]. Accessible training opportunities may support older drivers’ sense of dignity. While digitalization and automation have the potential to replace driver tasks, our results align with the literature, pointing out that skills like cargo handling, social competence and service orientation are perceived as indispensable, and as making human drivers irreplaceable [ 82, 83 ]. The persistent need for such skills is seen by the drivers as a source of job security, especially among the driver groups whose work involves human interaction. But even so, the fear of job loss is instilled by perceptions of cost-driven decision-making by companies and visible progress in implementation of self-driving vehicles, possibly rendering traditional driving roles obsolete. Our study further highlights the impacts of the trends on the current skillset that the drivers value and which they take pride in honing. It is known that the introduction of digitalization and automation brings the risk of deskilling workers through task fragmentation [ 84 ]. Our work suggests that deskilling together with drivers’ apprehensions about certain responsibilities being overlooked may undermine their sense of pride and recognition for their job competence, further undervaluing the profession. Employee retainment needs to preserve the jobs’ significance and meaning for the drivers. 5.1.2. Safety, work organization and health Our findings indicate that drivers recognized potential safety im - provements from the trends. Drivers further acknowledged potential benefits of an improved work environment with BEVs, and of enhanced health and performance through assistance in driving, administrative tasks and adherence to HoS regulations with digitalization and auto - mation. ADAS can be particularly beneficial for aging drivers, given the natural decline in their cognitive and visual capabilities [ 85 ]. The trends, however, do not guarantee these potential improvements. Concerns such as that automated driving increases the monotony of long-distance driving, or that additional distractions will be introduced, are echoed in the findings of Hungund [ 86 ]. Furthermore, we find that drivers harbour concerns about the ability of digital and autonomous systems to appropriately respond to dynamic road and traffic conditions, in line with DeGuzman & Donmez [ 87 ]. Our study also finds evidence that the needs of currently under-represented groups might be over - looked by the trends, such as women’s rest-stop location preferences in terms of sanitation or safety [ 88 ]. Regarding drivers’ perceived heightened safety risks from battery fires and their harmful gases, this is a case where perceived and actual risks deviate. Statistically, fire risks are not higher in electric vehicles [ 89 ], but more education and information on the difference between safety precautions with internal combustion engines and electric engines are evidently needed. Our findings also highlight particular safety challenges for drivers operating in rural areas due to infrastructure contingencies of the trends [ 90, 91 ] and the limited expansion of charging and telecommunications infrastructure in these areas [ 92, 93 ]. Our findings also illustrate potential tensions between operational changes that the trends may bring and how drivers’ work currently is organized. Interviewees and trade union representatives underscored risks of unachievable timeframes with digitalization and optimized route planning, exacerbating drivers’ time-pressure challenges [ 79 ]. Introducing BEVs and the need for charging to transport services further adds a layer of complexity to route planning and scheduling [ 94 ] and induces stress. Tensions such as how to count charging time add to drivers’ concerns about transport planners disregarding drivers’ expe - riences with the pressured nature of transport services.

{"page_content": "among drivers may be warranted by economic pressures stemming from market liberalizations, driving cost-cutting measures within transport services and inducing stressful time frames, as well as increased work - loads and hours [ 79, 95 ]. Being further away from retirement, younger drivers may be particularly susceptible to these risks. In line with the work of Belzer [ 95 ], we find that drivers’ other concerns revolve around customer expectations of transport services. Consumers often prefer free, next-day delivery [ 96 ], which our in - terviewees find harder to meet with the emergence of the trends without increasing stress or working longer days. These risks are linked to drivers’ perceptions of the lower flexibility of BEVs. However, recent studies suggest that consumers are willing to pay more for sustainable working conditions for drivers [ 97 ], or wait longer for low-emission last-mile deliveries [ 98 ]. The duality of our results shows that the perceived impact of the trends on drivers can go either way: electrification, digitalization and automation can lead to improvements in driver health and safety, but the trends can also diminish their quality of working life. The direction of the developments is shaped by the larger socio-structural changes intertwined with the technologies and by the institutional and gover - nance arrangements surrounding them [ 99 ]. New processes for designing transport services will be necessary. Decisions around the design and implementation of these processes should be informed by drivers’ deep understanding of logistics and should involve mutual dialogues with transport companies. The frame - work for these dialogues should be regulated by relevant national and regional authorities, which further necessitates dialogue between the authorities and transport worker unions. The aim should be to safeguard drivers’ dignity and working and employment conditions through ave - nues such as collective bargaining agreements and national and EU legislations. Without fostering dialogue that exploits the potential benefits of the new technologies for the driver profession, their implementation may create tensions and eventually make the sector unattractive. This could further lead to a suboptimal implementation of electrification, digitali - zation and automation at a larger scale, where issues could be attributed to technology immaturity instead of recognizing underlying reasons of failure. Based on our analysis, these reasons rather involve overlooking the workers’ perspectives in planning and procuring transport services. 5.2. Justice implications Keeping up with the technological changes driven by transport decarbonization requires the development of a range of new regulations, standards and skills-related measures. For instance, Articles 6 and 7 on driving times, breaks and rest periods in the EU regulation on the harmonization of certain social legislation relating to road transport [ 100 ] were developed primarily for internal combustion vehicles and do not fully account for BEV-specific requirements, such as charging time. Transport sector trade associations have highlighted the need to clarify rules to address how BEV charging affects drivers’ driving times and breaks, advocating for the possibility of interrupting mandated breaks in order to move fully charged vehicles [ 101 ]. There has been, however, some progress in protecting workers’ rights in the transition, with the adoption in 2024 of the EU Platform Work Directive, which clarifies the employment status of people working for digital platforms and estab - lished rules on the use of algorithm systems in the workplace [ 102 ]. However, this directive still needs to be transposed into national law and effectively enforced to provide an initial foundation for protecting workers’ rights. This illustrates the importance of current and future policy processes that define the rules surrounding the deployment of decarbonization technologies and thus determine whether the potential distributional injustices emerging in the transition are effectively addressed or left unresolved. From a procedural perspective, a key concern is the extent to and ways in which workers are involved in shaping such regulations and standards. Research has shown the importance of unions participating in organizational change processes to mitigate the restrictive impacts of these changes on job quality [ 103 ]. Although Sweden has a relatively well-functioning welfare system and has historically seen effective collaboration between unions and employers through the so-called “Swedish model” [ 104 ], it is unclear whether the current institutional framework is adequate to guarantee a socially and ecologically equitable transition [ 105 ]. While the new Climate Action Plan incorporates justice and acceptability as a key lens on the climate transition [ 24 ], the tangible policy responses in this plan are few, and the plan rather leans towards slowing the pace of the transition, e.g. watering down the nearer-term goals for the transport sector. From a recognition perspective, a key issue is that of better incor - porating transport workers’ knowledge into planning and decision- making, as these processes are increasingly performed by computers. One of them relates to the need to better account for and value drivers’ non-driving tasks, such as meeting specific customer demographics’ needs for taxi drivers or handling cargo security for truck and delivery drivers, in assessments of the transition’s implications on transport workers.

{"page_content": "between unions and employers through the so-called “Swedish model” [ 104 ], it is unclear whether the current institutional framework is adequate to guarantee a socially and ecologically equitable transition [ 105 ]. While the new Climate Action Plan incorporates justice and acceptability as a key lens on the climate transition [ 24 ], the tangible policy responses in this plan are few, and the plan rather leans towards slowing the pace of the transition, e.g. watering down the nearer-term goals for the transport sector. From a recognition perspective, a key issue is that of better incor - porating transport workers’ knowledge into planning and decision- making, as these processes are increasingly performed by computers. One of them relates to the need to better account for and value drivers’ non-driving tasks, such as meeting specific customer demographics’ needs for taxi drivers or handling cargo security for truck and delivery drivers, in assessments of the transition’s implications on transport workers. These can be essential for transport services to be carried out effectively, as well as for workers’ professional identity. This study points to aspects of the transition that have so far been neglected. While cultural and identity considerations are rarely priori - tized in transition planning, the literature on coal transitions has high - lighted how these factors can play a role in the societal acceptance of change [ 106, 107 ]. Finding ways to maintain key relationships with identity, place and people within communities can support transitions [ 108 ]. Our study indicates that these issues are relevant in the transport sector too, with decarbonization potentially leading to the loss of transport workers’ autonomy, enjoyment and pride. Importantly, research shows that autonomy and pride influence workers’ wellbeing and performance [ 109–111 ]. Strategies to ensure workers’ autonomy and pride amid decarbonization trends may focus on improving workers’ involvement in strategic decision-making and workplace so - ciability, as relationships with colleagues can mitigate the negative impacts of the lack of autonomy [ 112, 113 ]. Understanding how these responsibilities may evolve in the future and the resulting impact on workers’ wellbeing and transport service delivery necessitates increased attention in both research and policy discussions. Additionally, this research underscores a broader concern within the low-carbon transition and society’s escalating technological dependence and complexity: the preservation of workers’ dignity [ 84 ]. While this study identifies some variations in perceived implications of the transition depending on age, geography or gender, the findings remain limited. Still, the difficulty in interviewing women highlights challenges in fully capturing women’s perspectives and experiences in this male-dominated field. Truck and taxi driving remain gendered sectors, with women representing only 8 % of transport workers in Sweden in 2020 [ 114 ], and about 17 % in the EU and globally [ 115, 116 ]. There is an opportunity for including more women in the sector as the transition takes place and education and training processes evolve to match the new skills required. However, this is not a given; rather, it requires active measures to address gendered views of the sector, such as more flexible working arrangements, platforms to address gender bias in recruitments, affordable training opportunities and improving working conditions [ 116 ]. More research can help provide a better understand - ing of the challenges that particular groups may face, or the specific needs they may have. This is especially true for non-unionized drivers, who were under-represented in our sample, and for understanding the influence of gender norms on how the transition is experienced by men, women and people of other genders. 6. Conclusions and recommendations In this paper, we identified the implications of electrification, digi - talization and automation on the quality of working life for truck and J. Gong et al.

{"page_content": "taxi drivers, and explored how these vary from a gender, age and geographical perspective. We found several perceived challenges related to skills and identity, but also that drivers recognized the potential for the trends to improve their work environment, health and safety as well as aid their task performance. However, this potential cannot be taken for granted. The technologies can have both positive and negative im - plications, and it is rather human decisions – within institutional and governance systems, as well as broader societal and industrial shifts – that make transport workers question their future in the sector. There - fore, it is important to study the social processes that shape and adapt to the use of these technologies and the underlying factors that influence positive or negative developments in order to safeguard the sector ’ s future attractiveness. As the trends are likely to involve changes to skills and competency requirements, reskilling is essential to safeguard the dignity of the existing workforce. Opportunities to develop the necessary skills should be accessible to all groups of drivers. At the same time, the skills and knowledge that the drivers already possess should not be dismissed in the implementation of the technologies. Reskilling should be seen as a way to build on the advantages that drivers ’ knowledge offer, which would mean a much higher level of involvement for them in decision- making processes influencing the transition. Apart from driving itself, drivers highly value their skills in performing non-driving tasks, such as customer service and cargo handling, as well as the freedom to choose their own routes. These aspects are integral to consider for the drivers ’ sense of professional identity and job satisfaction. Drivers ’ deep knowledge on how the everyday logistics work can bring unique insights to where attention is needed in the implementa - tion of the technologies. Including these insights in decision-making can enhance the drivers ’ quality of working life and wellbeing while pre - serving their dignity. Further, it can potentially lead to a more fruitful implementation of the technologies, cultivate a fair share of benefits and support the sector ’ s future competitiveness. Many of the challenges that drivers face today are in the wake of cost- cutting strategies following deregulations of the road freight and taxi sectors. Our findings indicate that the emerging trends add complexity to an already strained sector, in which small margins risk exacerbating the challenges of a fast-paced work environment and deteriorating working conditions. These risks may further worsen the sector ’ s labour shortage challenges. We thus recommend that drivers ’ insights should be incorporated in policymaking to improve working conditions in the sector and to safeguard their occupational health and safety by ensuring decent wages and compliance to working hours regulations. Lastly, although the results indicate that the emergence of the technologies can influence driver groups differently based on age, gender and the geography they operate in, further data collection and analysis from a larger, more representative sample is needed to draw conclusions about how the perceived impacts of electrification, digita - lization and automation vary across these dimensions. Future research should focus on how social and behavioural aspects of the transition can be linked to technical trends and integrated into energy and socio-economic modelling, where such aspects usually are missing or simplified. This includes further exploration of how the transition is experienced by non-unionized workers and people of different genders, and how it relates to broader governance and socio- political structures. This type of work is particularly relevant in Euro - pean Union states as EU-level regulations are being developed that shape not only technological deployment but also employment rules. Our findings provide deeper insights into the previously under- researched impacts of vehicle electrification, digitalization and auto - mation on transport workers ’ everyday lives, contributing to the liter - ature on quality of working life and just transitions. The implications extend beyond the Swedish context and are relevant to workers in other sectors undergoing low-carbon transitions, especially considering that similar sector regulations exist across the EU. Results can guide trade unions, governments and businesses in developing supportive policies and strategies to ensure decent working conditions for transport workers.

Topic 1: Background Prompt: n/a Question 1.1: Could you tell me a bit about yourself? Where do you live and work, what type of transport do you work with, how long you have worked in the trucking/delivery/ taxi sector? Question 1.2: How many hours do you work per week? Question 1.3: How big is the company you work for? Question 1.4: What type of vehicle do you drive for work? Topic 2: Current working life Prompt: n/a Question 2.1: Can you please tell me about a typical day? Question 2.2: How far do you typically travel for work? Question 2.3: What challenges are you facing in your work life currently? Question 2.4: What do you like about your job? Question 2.5: What don’t you like about your job? Question 2.6: What would be a good vs. bad day of work for you? Question 2.7: What aspects of your work make you proud? Topic 3: Implications of decarbonization Prompt: 3a (asked prior to question 3.1): “The Swedish parliament have adopted a goal that Sweden should reach net zero CO2 emission by 2045. For the transport sector, this means zero emission by 2045 and that transport emission should be reduced by 70 % by 2030 compared to 2010. This means that a lot of change is coming with new low- emission technologies being introduced.” 3b (asked prior to question 3.2): “Imagine a future where the transport sector is rapidly changing towards electric vehicles. Both personal vehicles and trucks become battery electric to reduce emissions. Still, the transition can look quite different depending on, for example the range of electric vehicles and how charging takes place. We could see a gradual buildout of charging infrastructure, with charging taking place mostly overnight, at home and in depots, and changing usage patterns due to the limited range of electric vehicles. Or a rapid development of charging technology and extensive networks of fast charging stations, with standardized payment systems, enabling more flexible, but also costlier options for charging.” For each question, follow up with categories to cover as many as possible: A) In terms of health and safety? B) In terms of job security? C) In terms of skill requirements? Question 3.1: What trends regarding decarbonization in the trucking/delivery/taxi sector are you aware of? Where do you get this information from? Question 3.2: What benefits or opportunities do you think these trends will have for your work? Question 3.3: What risks or potential negative implications do you think these trends will have for your work? Question 3.4: What benefits or opportunities do you think these trends will have for the sector overall? Question 3.5: What risks or potential negative implications do you think these trends will have for the sector overall? Question 3.6: Do you think your answer would change if you were another gender or age? If you were unionized/not unionized? And how? Question 3.7: What do you think could help you navigate these changes in the sector better? Topic 4: Implications of digitalization and automation Prompt: 4a (asked prior to Question 4.1): “As elsewhere in society, digitalization and automation is influencing the developments in the transport sector.” 4b (asked prior to Question 4.2): “It is quite uncertain how digitalization and automation influence the transport sector. Examples of more limited impacts are improved route planning support for eco-driving. Digitalization with new ways of organizing work, through digital platforms and new types of business models for transport services such as Uber, means more change. And, finally, more autonomous and even fully self-driving vehicles would mean a very large change to road transport.” For each question, follow up with categories to cover as many as possible: A) In terms of health and safety? B) In terms of job security? C) In terms of skill requirements? Question 4.1: What trends regarding digitalization and automation in the trucking/ delivery/taxi sector are you aware of?

{"page_content": "Wave energy technology development in Ireland: Employing the triple helix model of innovation for pragmatic policy interventions ☆ C.A. Barry *, J.V. Ringwood Centre for Ocean Energy Research, Maynooth University, Co Kildare, Ireland ARTICLE INFO Keywords: Triple helix Wave energy policy Wave energy stakeholders Wind energy stakeholders Wave energy commercialisation ABSTRACT Irish wave energy technology holds significant economic potential and could be developed to establish an indigenous industry that addresses the global need for a diverse, robust, and reliable renewable energy system comprising a mix of modalities. While wave energy technology has not yet reached commercial viability, it could achieve it with adequate support facilitated by targeted public policy. It is clear that divergent stakeholder perspectives need to be considered when formulating policies, allowing for alternatives to be found, assumptions to be tested, and trust in government actions to be built. This is particularly pertinent for emerging renewable energy technologies such as wave energy, due to the interdependency between developers, policymakers, and researchers at early technology readiness levels. This study applies the triple helix innovation methodology to the wave energy technology sector within an Irish context, providing a framework within which often disparate stakeholder perspectives can be gathered and analysed, and consensus can be found. This consensus can influ - ence pragmatic policy developments for innovation. The study also provides empirical evidence of the need for supportive policy development for wave energy technology in Ireland. 1. Introduction 130 countries have committed to funding R & D of renewable energy technologies ( United Nations (2015), European Commission (2019) ) in order to build a robust and reliable energy system, that will necessarily comprise a mix of technologies ( Rourke et al. (2009); Guo and Ringwood (2021) ). Wave energy holds immense potential as a key component of the global transition to renewable energy with the potential to generate approximately 29,500 TWh of electricity annually, exceeding global electricity consumption in 2018 IRENA (2023). By 2050, the global market potential for ocean energy, including wave energy, is estimated to reach 350 GW IRENA (2020). In addition, wave energy can comple - ment wind and solar power by ensuring consistent supply during periods of low wind or solar output Fusco et al. (2010). The economic oppor - tunities associated with wave energy are significant. The Irish Depart - ment of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources estimates that Irish waters alone have a wave energy potential of 27.5 – 31.1 GW Sus - tainable Energy Authority of Ireland (2024a, b), which could contribute to the creation of up to 50,000 jobs in Ireland by 2050 Government of Ireland (2019). Opinions differ on the valuation of the global wave en - ergy market, with conservative estimates placing the value at $43.8 million in 2019, with projected Compound Annual Growth Rates (CAGR) of 17.8 % – 19.3 % Allied Market Research (2020), therefore reaching approximately $141.1 million by 2027. These factors under - score the potential of wave energy as a source of sustainable power, economic development, and energy security. Additionally, Ireland has a significant, globally recognised technical expertise in both fundamental and applied research, and wave energy device prototype development and testing ( Hu et al. (2022) ). This experience can be leveraged to create an indigenous wave energy technology industry in Ireland, benefiting from first to market status, as well as unencumbered access to the Eu - ropean marketplace. Despite the availability of a significant global wave resource ( Jin and Greaves (2021) ), and decades of dedicated academic and industrial endeavour, wave energy technology has not reached commercial viability, lagging behind other more mature technologies, with few projects going beyond the development mid-point ( European Commis - sion (2023a, b) ).

{"page_content": "of development, allocated to the projects most likely to succeed, will support wave energy technology development in becoming a sustainable indigenous industry for Ireland. Many wave energy technologies have foundered at mid-Technology Readiness Level (TRL) ( Weber (2012) ), due to an exponential increase in costs at that stage ( Markham et al. (2010); Fitzgerald and Sharkey (2012) ), as developers begin to move towards large-scale demonstration devices that need to be deployed and functioning at sea for sustained periods. TRL is a metric commonly used by researchers and public funding bodies, to assess and express the readiness of individual wave energy technology projects. TRL is also used by policy makers to express targets Barry and Ringwood (2023). Supportive public policy, that provides, inter alia, access to funding for technology developers, is crucial, particularly at the mid-point of wave energy technology development. Fiscally prudent public funding bodies would endeavour to ensure that funding is allocated to those projects most likely to succeed. The development towards a commercially viable indigenous wave energy technology industry involves complex problems being addressed by diverse stakeholder groups across multiple projects and stages of technological development. High levels of cooperation between different stakeholder groups are required for the progression of wave energy technology development. The Triple Helix (TH) innovation model, described in Section 2, is based on the dynamic relationships between industry, academia and government stakeholder groups, and can be used to develop pragmatic and practical policy measures evolving from consensus between the three stakeholder groups. There is a paucity of literature detailing stakeholder perspectives on non-technical barriers to wave energy commercialisation. O’Ha - ganHuertasO’CallaghanGreaves (2016) focus on the need for a stream - lined consenting process, and recognise the need for early participation of stakeholders, in consultation with policy makers. Otherwise, the literature has not addressed, systematically or empirically, the TH ac - tors’ contributions to Offshore Renewable Energy (ORE) development, in terms of overlapping and or divergent perspectives. Few studies have associated the TH role with renewable energy sources, and then only focusing on particular details, as described by Lerman, Gerstlberger, Lima, and Frank, Klitkou and Godoe (2013), Deakin and Reid (2018), Hettinga et al. (2018). This study addresses a significant gap in renewable energy policy formulation, by proposing a framework that facilitates data collection, promotes collaborative innovation, and integrates diverse stakeholder perspectives. By applying the TH innovation model to the case of wave energy development in Ireland, the authors identify a framework within which consensus among different stakeholder groups can be found, providing insights that are essential for pragmatic and practical policy formulation, that would help an indigenous wave energy industry to emerge. Given the emergent status of wave energy technology, the TH framework is particularly relevant, set within a diverse stakeholder landscape, with recent policy changes, and Ireland’s recognised exper - tise in this sector. This approach not only contributes to the advance - ment of wave energy technology in Ireland, but also offers a replicable model for other emerging renewable energy technologies, in Ireland and in other countries. Furthermore, through comprehensive surveys and interviews, the study delivers empirical evidence on the fundamental requirements that stakeholders believe policymakers need to address in relation to wave energy, thereby offering valuable guidance for policy development both in Ireland and internationally. Following the Introduction, Section 2 introduces the TH model in the context of wave energy. Section 3 provides a retrospective application of the model to wind energy technology development in Denmark as an exemplar of successful tripartite commercialisation, while Section 4 discusses the application of the methodology to Irish wave energy technology development. Section 5 provides results and discussion, and Section 6 concludes and discusses potential future work. 2. Methodology - application of the triple helix model to the Irish wave energy sector The Triple Helix model differentiates along the traditional lines of universities, industries, and government as its starting point, taking account of the expanding role of the knowledge sector in relation to the political and economic infrastructure of society Leydesdorff and Etzko - witz (1996). The growing interactions among universities, industries, and government have led to new structures, such as university centers and corporate alliances. These interactions have also fostered inte - grating mechanisms. It is at the point of interaction, Leydesdorff argues, that innovation takes place. Indeed, the three stakeholder groups, intrinsic to the development of wave energy technology towards com - mercial viability, are: universities, industry, and government. The au - thors apply the TH innovation model to find consensus within the differing interests and obligations of each stakeholder group, in order to influence positive and pragmatic policy development, towards “systemic innovations that transcend the technologies and competencies of their individual spheres”( Anttonen et al.", "metadata": {"producer": "Acrobat Distiller 8.1.0 (Windows)", "creator": "Elsevier", "creationdate": "2025-04-25T16:49:12+00:00", "crossmarkdomains[1]": "elsevier.com", "crossmarkmajorversiondate": "2010-04-23", "creationdate--text": "26th April 2025", "elsevierwebpdfspecifications": "7.0.1", "robots": "noindex", "moddate": "2025-04-26T11:07:07+00:00", "author": "C.A.

The au - thors apply the TH innovation model to find consensus within the differing interests and obligations of each stakeholder group, in order to influence positive and pragmatic policy development, towards “systemic innovations that transcend the technologies and competencies of their individual spheres”( Anttonen et al. (2018) ). The TH model was introduced and developed in the 1990s by Etz - kowitz and Leydesdorff ( Etzkowitz and Leydesdorff (1995); Etzkowitz and Leydesdorff (2000) ), and is described as an innovation model, based on the dynamic relationships between universities, industry, and gov - ernment institutions. The TH model describes the actions of universities as generators of new knowledge, industry as producers of new tech - nologies, and governments as regulators and potential supporters of new technologies. The model reflects the change into a knowledge-based society, in which institutions develop intersections preserving not only their identities and main roles, but also assuming other roles as neces - sary ( Ranga and Etzkowitz (2015) ). The TH model aims to foster eco - nomic and social development, by promoting collaboration and knowledge sharing among these three sectors ( Etzkowitz and Ley - desdorff (1995) ). The authors adopt the TH model, with the objective of examining how wave energy technology commercialisation can be expedited. The authors demonstrate how the TH model can be used to find consensus among the main stakeholder groups, which is essential for the formulation of supportive renewable energy policy, and the integration of energy policy with practice. 2.1. Why is TH relevant for wave energy technology development? The TH model of innovation is based on the interactions between the three following elements and their associated ‘initial role’ Lawton Smith and Leydesdorff (2014), universities engaging in basic research, in - dustries producing commercial goods, and governments that are regu - lating markets Leydesdorff (2006, pp. 42–76). As interactions increase, each sector evolves to adopt characteristics of the other institution, which then gives rise to hybrid institutions. Fig. 1 shows the overlap between the 3 TH sectors. This is evident within Irish wave energy technology development. The university actors, or knowledge generators, are principally involved in incremental technical improvements, at lower TRLs. In Ireland the availability of funding is seen as reasonable or good within this sector, and is accessible from national funding bodies such as Research Ireland (RI) (formerly Science Foundation Ireland (SFI)), the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI), and the Marine Institute (MI), as well as from EU programmes such as Horizon Europe, European Commission (2021a, b) ). Lerman et al. (2021) see the university contribution as solely the provision of knowledge transfer and generation, where universities face the “endless frontier” ( Etzkowitz and Leydesdorff (1995) ) of basic research, funded as an end in itself, with practical results expected only in the long-term. However, it is difficult to categorise respondents as solely existing within the academic TH sector, as the role of universities is changing to an extent to an “endless transition” model, in which basic research is linked to utilisation through a series of intermediate pro - cesses ( Callon (1998) ), often stimulated by government.

{"page_content": "observed in the case of Irish wave energy development, where firms such as Wave Venture (2024) have ‘spun-out ’ from universities, and multi-actor funding programmes support collaboration between in - dustry and academia ( Enterprise Ireland Innovation Partnership Pro - gramme (2024), Science Foundation Ireland Industry Fellowship Programme (2017) ). This shows an overlap between respondents from the academic TH sector with those from the industry TH sector. Industry stakeholders involved in wave energy technology develop - ment also rely heavily on public funding at early TRLs, and can benefit from academic collaborations “ when two helices are shaping each other mutually, co-evolution may lead to stabilisation along a trajectory … where governments can intervene by helping to create a new market or changing the rules of the game\" ( Etzkowitz and Leydesdorff (2000) ). Essentially, the TH model can be applied by policy makers as an “ interface strategy ” ( OECD (1980) ) in order to move projects to the ‘market pull ’ phase of development, from the ‘technology push ’ phase, to overcome the so-called Valley of Death (VoD) ( Weller et al. (2014) ). The TH government ’ s objectives centre around economic drivers and policy targets ( European Commission (2021a, b), Government of Ireland (2021a, b) ). The industry sphere highlights business opportunities, and the academic objectives centre around the generation of knowledge. Anttonen et al. (2018) noted that conceptual differences can inhibit progress. In wave energy device development, industry aspires to full-scale devices in the water, producing energy, to demonstrate effi - cacy and reliability to potential private investors, whereas universities face the “ endless frontier ” of fundamental research which does not hold the same constraints. Governments seek renewable energy sources that can economically compete with other mature technologies. The purpose of the TH model is to find what Anttonen et al. (2018) called the “ consensus space ”, essentially where the competencies and objectives of each stakeholder group can be aligned to achieve progress and enhanced development. By analysing survey and interview data from stakeholders in the wave energy sector in Ireland, many of whom hold a position in a hybrid space between TH sectors, we demonstrate the applicability of the TH model in identifying a consensus space for the advancement of wave energy technology. This consensus space is crucial for facilitating informed and pragmatic policy development, required by wave energy technology developers, to reach commercial viability. 3. A retrospective application of the TH model to Danish wind energy development As an exemplar of successful tripartite commercialisation, this study applies the TH model to Danish wind energy technology development through the 1980s and 1990s. Denmark pioneered wind energy tech - nology development from the late 19th and through the 20th centuries, and successfully developed the technology and exploited it commer - cially, to the extent that Denmark exported € 8.9bn of wind energy technology in 2022. The most significant period of growth, for Danish wind energy technology development, was during the 1980s and 1990s, as a response to the global oil crisis in 1973. Danish wind energy technology development TH stakeholders, much as in the case of wave energy in Ireland, could be said to have divergent motivations for supporting this emerging renewable energy technology. However, in applying the TH theory that innovation resides at the intersection between TH groups, it is clear that policy played a crucial enabling role in ensuring the successful development of wind energy technology in Denmark through \"a visionary consensus over a long period of time\" ( De La Porte et al. (2022) ). Table B in the Appendix describes some of the key stakeholders involved in wind energy development in Denmark from 1980 to 2000, their roles and motivations, including members from each TH group. It is clear that, although the ultimate prize of commercial viability is important to all TH actors (although it has been argued that this is perhaps to a lesser extent within the university sphere), there are differing areas of focus, as well as different goals. The Ris ø Test Centre was initially established by the Danish gov - ernment to conduct research into nuclear power. In the early 1970s, it was given the role of providing ‘type approval ’ for wind turbines and also acted as a technology hub for the wind energy community, by sharing research gathered from companies seeking type approval. Speculators that wanted to take advantage of the government 30% installation cost subsidy at the time were required to seek certification from Ris ø, in the knowledge that findings would be shared with other developers ( Barry and Ringwood (2023) ).

Certification led the way to regu - lation and improved design and quality, and Denmark quickly gained a reputation for producing high quality turbines, essential for its success globally. Although comparisons can be drawn between the path to commercial readiness for wind energy technology in Denmark, and for wave energy technology in Ireland, particularly with regard to availability of resource, population size, political will, and high capital costs, two of the differences that are worth noting due to their effect on public and investor perception, include lack of consensus on a design archetype, and lack of public awareness for wave energy. Wind turbines, from a non-technical perspective are recognisable as close relations to their historical wind mill counterparts that people have been familiar with for hundreds of years. Wave energy, on the other hand, has many device design types, differing widely in terms of appearance and effectiveness (Falcao, 2010; Guo et al., 2021). The design challenges for wave energy converters and uncertain techno - logical, economic, and ecological systems, overcoming the structural challenges of ocean deployment, and dealing with complex system dynamics — have led to a disjointed progression of research and devel - opment (Trueworthy et al., 2020). Interestingly, one of the perceived drawbacks of wind energy, NIMBYISM, or public acceptability, (Devine, 2005), could be an argument in favour of wave energy for less visibly intrusive devices, although the lack of public awareness of wave energy dilutes this benefit. The Danish scheme takes account of the university objective to generate knowledge by having access to turbine plans, for the industrial sphere to generate technology through the requirement of type approval, and a vehicle through which the government could support both the industrial and academic partners. Such a scheme shows an understanding, by policy makers, that different stakeholder groups must work in a symbiotic manner to achieve progress. The Danish government has been willing to commit to long-term, stable policies and interventions, which have provided certainty, and Fig. 1. Triple Helix stakeholders. C.A. Barry and J.V.

{"page_content": "have played an important role in fostering the commercial success and longevity of Danish wind energy technology development. From 1979 to 1989, approximately € 38 million was granted under the capital invest - ment scheme. Funding was also available for test centers to disseminate knowledge. Income from wind turbines was taxed favourably until 1996 when the technology had matured. Further incentives were available, including tax deductions, and a 10-year agreement with (not-for-profit) utilities guaranteeing turbine owners feed-in tariffs amounting to 70 – 85 % of retail electricity prices. When the market had matured, the Danish government introduced green certificates, and Danish consumers were obliged to buy at least 20 % of their electricity from renewable sources. These Danish wind energy policy initiatives could be described as stakeholder co-design in policy development. In other words, stakeholders are built into policy formulation from its conception. Adopting strategies of this kind, provides vital support for emerging renewable technologies such as wave energy, as they strive to reach commercial viability. 4. Employing the TH framework for Irish wave energy commercialisation The authors conducted a survey to extract valuable data about the commercialisation of wave energy technology in Ireland. The target population of this survey comprises TH stakeholders with some interest or involvement in wave energy technology development. The study is focused on the Irish marketplace, due to the accessibility of data, as well as Ireland ’ s reputation, both academically and commercially, in wave energy, the prevalence of new policy measures in the renewable energy sphere, and its unencumbered proximity to the EU market. Additionally, the extent of Ireland ’ s abundant wave resource can provide motivation for the development of indigenous wave energy technology. This methodology can be replicated by other countries developing wave energy technology. 4.1. Description of respondents Over a 12-month period, 82 questionnaires and 14 interviews were conducted with stakeholders from within the wave energy sector, including students, researchers, technology developers, policy pro - fessionals, and other actors who provide support to the area, such as consultants, lawyers, and finance professionals. Table C in the Appendix shows the demographics of the final sample group, divided by TH classification and Table D lists the interviewees. The TH model presumes that, as interactions increase between actors, respondents might come to occupy a hybrid space between TH groups. In these cases, the starting point of the organisation determines the TH group ( Leydesdorff, 2006 ). Indeed, it is clear from the list of respondents, that many of the stake - holders could hold a position in 2 or 3 of the TH groups, which the TH theory suggests creates a positive environment within which innovation can flourish. The questionnaire consisted of 8 questions (Appendix, Table A), including single-answer multiple choice questions, Likert scale questions Joshi et al. (2015) to measure attitudes and opinions, rank order ques - tions allowing respondents to compare potential answers, deomographic or firmographic questions to determine respondents ’ backgrounds, and an open-ended question to gather in-depth qualitative data. The in - terviews were conducted either in-person or online, were semi-formal, and were 30 minutes in duration. Although 68 % of the survey re - spondents requested anonymity, all of the interviewees gave their con - sent for their names and affiliations to be made public. For semi-structured interviews the authors employ a process known as “ coding ”. Codes may be described as “ tags or labels for assigning units of meaning to the descriptive or inferential information compiled during a study ” Miles (1994). This allows the clustering of key issues in the data Young et al. (2018). 4.2. Limitations Certain limitations were encountered when relying on the ques - tionnaire as a sole source of qualitative data, particularly when answers required a level of respondent expertise or experience. Limitations included differences in understanding of the challenges. In addition, respondents may not have given equal consideration and time to their responses. For this reason, in-depth, semi-structured interviews were conducted, with high-level wave energy experts listed in Table D of the Appendix. It is relevant to note that many of the industry TH stake - holders also have an academic affiliation, reflecting the emerging nature of wave energy technology development. The interviewee responses feed into the analysis of the survey results, and provide clarity and validation, as well as a more in-depth insider perspective. Although this study focuses on the commercialisation of the Irish wave energy technology industry, views were sought from wave energy technology developers, from multiple jurisdictions, reflecting the reality of cross-jurisdictional project funding schemes, and in order to gain perspectives from senior employees of some of the globally leading wave energy companies. 5.

Results and discussion The following section will analyse the results of the questionnaire and the interviews, while comparing responses from each TH group. In analysing the data, we will make use of Chi-Square test McHugh (2013) and ANOVA Analysis St, Wold et al. (1989). The Chi-Square test is pri - marily used to analyse categorical data, where the variables are non-numerical, and can be divided into distinct categories. It determines if there is a significant difference between the observed and expected frequencies within different groups. ANOVA is used to analyse numer - ical data between three or more groups. It compares the mean responses of these groups to determine if there is a significant difference between them. 5.1. Finding 1: wave energy will be supplying the (Irish) electricity grid within 10 years, but is not high priority for policy makers Although 95.8 % of respondents believe that wave energy should be part of the renewable energy mix, there is a presumed bias, in that the target respondent group are those involved, in either an academic or professional capacity, in ocean energy. However, respondents were also asked how many years they believe it will take for wave energy to supply the Irish electricity grid. Fig. 2 clearly shows that there is clear consensus Fig. 2.

{"page_content": "between TH groups, with a mean of 10 years across all three TH groups, and few outliers. The authors perform an ANOVA analysis, as demonstrated in Ta - bles 1 and 2, to determine whether the similarities in mean responses between groups occur by chance, or if they are statistically significant. The F-Value is the ratio between the \"between groups\" variation and the \"within groups\" variation. Since the F-Value is smaller than the \"within group\" variation, we can deduct that the difference between the groups is not statistically significant. Additionally, since the P-Value (probability value), which describes the probability that the results could have happened by chance, is more than 0.05 (the value that commonly serves as the threshold for statistical significance), we can conclude that there is no statistically significant difference between the mean responses of the groups being compared. The ANOVA analysis shows that there is good agreement between wave energy technology TH groups, in that wave energy TH stake - holders believe that wave energy will be in a position to supply the Irish electricity grid within 10 years. However, this is not supported by na - tional policy. The Climate Action Plan 2024 (CAP) ( The Oireachtas (2023) ) provides an annually-updated road-map for actions that will be taken to halve Ireland ’ s emissions by 2030, and reach net zero by no later than 2050, as committed to in the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act 2021 ( Government of Ireland (2021a, b) ). The CAP expresses the \"significant potential to develop offshore renewable energy from wind, wave and tidal sources\", and details the importance of research and innovation infrastructure for ocean energy projects, such as test sites. It does not set any targets for deployment for wave energy, focusing instead on more mature technologies such as offshore wind, for which it sets a target of 5 GW installed capacity by 2030. It is clear, that although TH stakeholders agree that wave energy will be part of the Irish electricity gird within 10 years, wave energy is treated as being within the research and development remit of public policy, rather than as a high-potential, near-future constituent of the renewable energy mix. \"Wave energy is running out of time. Governments need to support\" Anders K ø hler, Floating Power Plant 5.2. Finding 2. There is a need for more focused funding from national funding bodies The authors asked survey respondents whether public funding for wave energy developers should be directed at a particular phase of technology development maturity (i.e. at a particular TRL range ( Malali and Marchand (2020) )). Although there is a lack of an all-encompassing taxonomy for TRL levels, in general they have been adapted for wave energy technology development as follows Bertram (2020); Ruehl and Bull (2012); Ji et al. (2016): • TRL 1 – 3 Concept validation. (Wave flume tests at a small scale). • TRL 4 Design validation, (intermediate scale testing, Flume tests scale 1:10, Survivability; Computational Fluid Dynamics; Finite Element Analysis Dynamic Analysis; Engineering Design (Proto - type); feasibility and costing. • TRL 5 – 6 Testing operational scaled models at sea and subsystem testing at large scale. • TRL 7 – 8 Full-scale prototype testing at sea. • TRL 9 - Economic validation. Pre-commercial devices tested at sea for an extended period. Respondents answered the question of funding needs based on 3 TRL phases: TRL 1 – 3, the research phase; TRL 4 – 6, technology development and demonstration phase, where academia and industry are most likely to intersect and where costs increase exponentially between TRLs; and TRL 7 – 9, system development and launch phase. The authors find that most respondents (62 %), believe that funding should be targeted at a particular maturity level, but with a significant minority either not sure (22 %), or who do not believe that funding should be targeted at a particular maturity level (15.5 %). Of those who do believe funding should be targeted at a particular maturity level, 59 % believe that funding should be targeted at TRL 4 – 6, or the mid- maturity point. Applying the TH model, we can see that there is good agreement among the TH groups ( Fig. 3 ). The only anomaly would seem to be that 29 % of the industry group believe that funding should be targeted at the upper maturity levels, whereas only 14 % and 16 % of the academic and government groups agree with this.

{"page_content": "energy projects: Science Foundation Ireland ( Science Foundation Ireland (2017) ), the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland ( Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (2024a, b) ), and the Marine Institute ( Marine Institute (2022) ), within a 10 year period, and attempt to discern whether each project would be placed at low, mid, or high TRL. These findings were compared to EU funding distributions, where Ireland was the coordinating (lead) partner, and also to venture capital investment. Fig. 4 shows that most funding was focused on the lower TRLs. It is important to note that patterns in public funding do not match the stated funding preferences of stakeholders from any of the TH groups, in the authors ’ findings in this study. TRL was used as a metric in this study due to its proliferation across stakeholder groups, functioning as a simple means of communicating a level of commercial maturity. The use of a simple system that is well known has clear benefits. The TRL scale is useful to offset risk concerns for potential investors and funding bodies. However, different iterations focus mainly on experimentation and prototype demonstration, but do not adequately address technical con - cerns such as control strategies, telemetry design, and large-scale testing, or non-fiscal supports, such as availability (or not) of testing facilities, making TRL incomplete as an assessment tool. The TRL scale does not take account of the fact that commercial readiness does not necessarily equate to performance readiness. Weber, in 2012, Weber (2012) introduced the Technology Perfor - mance Level (TPL) metric, complementary to the TRL scale, that considered the economic performance of WEC systems early in their development. TPL shows that funding is required across the TRL scale ( Fig. 5 ). Weber ’ s study described the TPL scale as a value map for vis - ualisation, qualification and comparison of the technology development status with respect to overall commercial readiness and performance, and as such is more related to innovation than TRL. Barry and Ringwood (2023). Where TRL measures the commercial readiness of the technol - ogy, TPL measures how well a technology performs, or the economic ability of the technology throughout its development (Weber, Costello, and Ringwood 2013). In particular, TPL assesses the cost drivers such as environmental, social and legal acceptability, power absorption and conversion, system availability, capital expenditure and lifecycle oper - ational expenditure. TPL is designed to be complementary to TRL and TPL, when combined with TRL, can identify requirements for successful entry, survival in the electricity market, and assess the value of the technology when making investment/funding decisions as it measures the economic ability of the project. TPL can be used by all TH stake - holder groups, technology developers for iterative design feed-back and to identify areas of improvement and find fatal flaws early; by investors to conduct due diligence; by reviewers to assess wave energy technology project proposals, and make funding decisions; and by researchers to formulate R & D strategies Barry and Ringwood (2024). For this reason, TPL, if it gains popularity, would be a preferable metric from which to evaluate stakeholder perspectives. VoD is used to describe the phenomenon whereby a technology, while ready to be deployed from a technological standpoint, is not yet ready to compete with similar technologies, and full commercialisation has yet to be achieved. ( Muscio et al. (2023) ). Weller et al. (2014) suggest that, in order to overcome the VoD, new technologies need to be de-risked in terms of component reliability and durability, i.e. when the technology push support runs out but there is no market pull, public support needs to step in until technology performance has been vali - dated. The responses to our surveys and interviews show a recognition of this phenomenon, where the majority of respondents (59 %) would prefer public funding aimed at mid-TRLs. \"The best way to support companies is to create clear and sustained market pull that will motivate investors to support companies for the entire development and roll out.\" Christopher Ridgewell, CEO, AW-Energy Previous research such as that of Ford et al.

{"page_content": "viability and policy stability. Responses from interviewees show a disconnection between policy makers and those working at the coal face. Patrick Walsh, CEO of Limerick Wave, mentioned that the \"biggest problem facing wave energy is the difficulty of getting funding at mid-TRLs\". R ´emi Gruet, CEO of Europewave agrees \"[wave energy technology developers] need to source public funding as the cost of finance is too high\". \"We need funding supports at mid-TRLs, and guarantees for investors.\" Tony Lewis, Ocean Energy ltd 5.3. Finding 3. Lack of a wave energy champion and levelised cost of energy are the most pressing challenges facing wave energy technology development Survey respondents were asked to rank the most pressing challenges facing wave energy development in Ireland in terms of commercialisa - tion potential. They were given 4 options derived from the studies of Aderinto and Li (2018), Guo et al. (2023), Bailey et al. (2011) etc., and from interview responses: • Public perception of wave energy • Lack of a wave energy champion; someone who can exert influence at policy level • LCoE, compared to other sources of renewable energy • Lack of design convergence • Other LCoE is found to be one of the most pressing challenges facing the development of wave energy technology overall. However, industry and government representatives both stated that lack of a champion, a person who can exert influence at policy level, is seen as a slightly more pressing need for wave energy technology development in Ireland. The results can be seen in Fig. 6. A chi-square test of independence is used to examine the relationship between TH groups, and their respective perspectives on the most pressing challenges facing wave energy development, to determine whether the observed deviations between the TH groups are statistically significant, or can be attributable to chance. The contrast between these variables was significant, the chi-square statistic is 32.8606. The p -value is 0.000065. The result is significant where p < 0.05. Table 4 shows that there is a difference between the responses from different stakeholder groups, in that the academic TH group believe that the relatively high LCoE for wave energy, is the most pressing challenge facing wave energy technology development, whereas the industry and government groups feel that a wave energy champion might have more impact if they meet their goal of garnering the required policy support for the development of an Irish wave energy technology industry. Several respondents added commentary, stressing that the role of the champion is to drive supportive policy initiatives for the wave energy community. They commented inter alia that there is a \"lack of a policy driver to allow for sustained R & D investment\"; \"many developers are very small-scale business-wise and need support to develop\"; \"a research institution for the EU would be good\"; \"the government needs to support full scale demonstrations\" In relation to LCoE, it is unsurprising that the academic TH group noted this as a pressing challenge facing wave energy technology development. The EU have ambitious LCoE targets for wave energy technology ( European Commission (2023a, b) ) and research proposals, seeking funding, regularly state an LCoE target as a measurable deliv - erable. However, it is very challenging to obtain a true LCoE estimate at the early design stages, due to considerable uncertainties, and true economic valuation can only be obtained through economies of scale and maturation of knowledge, which cannot be obtained until there are more demonstration devices at sea ( T ˆetu and Fernandez Chozas (2021) ). \"Governments need to be ready to take risks. We know we can make [wave energy] work, but at what price?\" R ´emi Gruet, CEO, Ocean Energy Europe 5.4.

Conclusions and policy implications This study underscores the importance of incorporating stakeholder perspectives into the formulation of policy, particularly in the context of emerging technologies such as wave energy technology development. Furthermore, the use of the Triple Helix Framework (THF) is instru - mental in ensuring that data is gathered, and analysis is conducted beneficially in a manner that supports effective future policy formulation. The consensus among Triple Helix stakeholder groups demonstrated in this study supports the theory that innovation thrives when it aligns with shared priorities across academia, industry, and government, fostering synergistic collaboration and mutually beneficial outcomes. This underscores the need for policies that encourage dialogue, bridge stakeholder interests, and create frameworks to support collaborative ecosystems (Peter Hamilton, interview 2024), ultimately driving Fig. 6.

{"page_content": "sustainable innovation and economic growth. Specifically, applying the THF can significantly influence Irish wave energy policy, which is crucial for advancing wave energy technology commercialisation, ensuring that policymakers identify a consensus space where the needs of various stakeholder groups are adequately addressed, formulating pragmatic and practical policies, thereby facili - tating the achievement of policy objectives. The retrospective application of THF, to Danish wind energy devel - opment in the 1980s and 1990s, serves as a valuable case study. It highlights the importance of balancing different stakeholder needs and objectives in policy formulation, providing a framework that could enhance awareness and integration of diverse perspectives in policy development. Our analysis reveals evidence that the current policy landscape for wave energy is misaligned with stakeholder needs, particularly regarding funding at the mid-TRLs. To bridge the VoD, and ensure the successful and timely integration of wave energy into the grid, policy - makers must prioritise and invest in technologies at mid-TRLs. Notably, the expectation among all stakeholder groups, that wave energy will supply the grid within the next decade, is not reflected in Irish policy, despite having more visibility in EU policy. Furthermore, we find that LCoE is of concern to stakeholders, particularly those in the academic field, and despite difficulties with an accurate assessment, it is not an appropriate metric for evaluating wave energy technology in its current stage of development. There is a need for new or adapted models to better guide funding decisions and assess where investments can be most impactful. The need for a wave energy champion, expressed in the analysis of the results, shows that stakeholders recognise the need for additional cooperation between TH groups, led by someone who can move between the three groups, act as a spokesperson, and exert influence at a policy level. This study provides a framework from which different emerging renewable energy technologies in other countries can benefit. New policy is being developed rapidly in the renewable energy area, in line with national and international priorities. It is essential that any new policy recognises and analyses stakeholders ’ perspectives, to ensure that new policy is targeted where it is most needed, has buy-in, is robust, and practical. Public perception of wave energy is limited and, as such, was not part of this study. As wave energy technology progresses through the TRLs, future research might consider a quadruple helix approach, incorpo - rating public perspectives more comprehensively into policy formulation. This study emphasises the necessity of aligning policy with stake - holder needs, showing how innovation resides at the intersection be - tween stakeholder groups, through the use of the THF, and provides empirical evidence to show stakeholder perspectives for the Irish case of wave energy. This will help to ensure that future policy in the area of marine renewable energies, are robust and responsive to the often divergent views of its stakeholders.

Using survey data from six Central EU countries — Austria, Czechia, Germany, Hungary, Poland, and Slovakia — we find that exposure to technology heightens fear of automation, as do task substitution and routineness. Younger, less-educated, and lower-income individuals, as well as those who perceive a greater lack of control, are more afraid of automation, while gender does not show a significant effect. In conclusion, we discuss how fear of automation may impact reskilling motivation in organizational practices. 1. Introduction The fear of automation — the concern that machines will replace human labor — has resurfaced with each wave of technological change, reflecting historical anxieties that date back to the Industrial Revolution [ 1 ]. Work is a fundamental aspect of modern human life, providing not only income but also structure, routine, and a foundation for social re - lationships. It significantly contributes to an individual ’ s identity, shaping who we are both personally and socially [ 2, 3 ]. When work is disrupted, society can become unbalanced, as demonstrated by Jahoda and Lazarsfeld ’ s [ 4 ] classic Marienthal study, which documented how mass unemployment in a 1930s Austrian village eroded social cohesion, undermined individual well-being, and destabilized community life. The Fourth Industrial Revolution brings forth an increased potential for the automation of work due to the application of artificially intelli - gent machines. Moreover, the current wave of technological change has a wider scope and faster pace than its previous iterations. The combi - natorial nature of the innovation process, focused on data and infor - mation, leads to an almost geometric progression in digital technologies. This growth holds the promise of automating not just physical tasks but, increasingly, cognitive ones as well, presenting both potential and risk. The recent development of multimodal Generative AI (GAI) — a form of artificial intelligence technology that can autonomously produce text, images, and even code — heralds yet another breakthrough, promising profound transformations in the labor market, particularly in creative and educational sectors [ 5 ]. The future of work seems more uncertain than ever, affecting even the authors of this article — cognitive workers in academia — who experience AI technologies encroaching upon their fundamental duties. Just as the Luddites sought to destroy steam-powered looms two hundred years ago during the Industrial Revolution to protect their jobs, in 2023, Hollywood screenwriters and actors went on strike to defend their intellectual property from the threat of artificial intelligence al - gorithms generating text and images. But do workers in general fear automation as acutely? This was the primary question that shaped the design of our research. A preliminary analysis of survey data from over 6600 workers across six European countries (Austria, Czechia, Germany, Hungary, Poland, and Slovakia) collected at the turn of 2021 showed that, despite the extensive literature on risks of technological unem - ployment and growing media hype, for many workers this remains a rather baffling issue. A surprising 37 % of our respondents selected the “ no opinion ” option on the intentionally provocative statement intended to stimulate more decisive responses: “ I feel that the development of new technologies and the associated automation of tasks will lead to mass unemployment within the next 10 years. ” Still, one in three participants agreed with the statement, mirroring the findings of Golin and Rauh [ 6 ], * Corresponding author.

{"page_content": "who reported that 35 % of respondents fear “ displacement through technology ”. In this article, we assume that as technology progresses faster than ever, more workers are likely to worry about automation. This un - derscores both the need to refine the conceptual frameworks used to describe and analyze this phenomenon and to conduct further system - atic research on the determinants of fear of automation. Consequently, we aim to make a twofold contribution to the litera - ture. First, we join the ongoing effort to develop the notion of the “ fear of automation, ” seeking to clarify to bring some clarity to the termino - logical abundance that borders on chaos, arising from inconsistent definitions and overlapping usage of terms like “ technophobia, ” “ tech - noparanoia, ” and “ fear of automation ” in recent studies. We begin with a psychological definition of fear and move towards a more sociological approach, treating fear as a phenomenon deeply rooted in culture and society, especially in late modernity. On this basis, we propose a theo - retically grounded conceptualization of fear of automation, combining individual perception of the risk of automation within one ’ s professional tasks, the feeling of job insecurity, and the belief that technological unemployment awaits us all. Secondly, building on this conceptual development, we seek to assess the role of specific factors determining fear of automation. We construct our argument in two stages. Referring to the extensive literature on the impact of technology on the labor market, including approaches focusing on skill-biased and routine-biased technological changes, we first identify groups of workers who are objectively vulnerable — defined as those whose jobs involve routine and repetitive tasks that are highly susceptible to automation, as demonstrated by task-based risk assess - ments in the literature — and may justifiably fear the impact of auto - mation on the security of their jobs. Next, we review studies that specifically focus on identifying the determinants of fear of automation. This step concludes with the formulation of hypotheses regarding the significance of several key factors identified in the literature in shaping fear of automation, namely exposure to technology, the nature of work tasks in relation to repetitiveness, perceived control over one ’ s life, and labor market position. We also address the research gap by incorpo - rating a personal dimension of technology exposure — a worker ’ s expe - rience with technology at workplace — going beyond generalized occupational and sectoral exposure. In the results section, we provide a data description summarizing the statistics of the selected variables. Next, we conduct econometric modeling to investigate the relationships between these variables and fear of automation more deeply. We find that an increase in each dimension of the digitalized work environ - ment — personal (workplace technology experience), occupational (task routineness) and sectoral (technology exposure) — is associated with a heightened fear of automation. Furthermore, a lower sense of control over life, along with a weaker labor market position, is linked to higher fear of automation. The discussion grounds the results of the study in the literature, particularly with reference to the theories of skill-biased and routine- biased task change under technological impact, and demonstrates its practical application within organizations undergoing digital trans - formation. The value of our study lies not only in providing new empirical evidence on the determinants of fear of automation, including a comprehensive perspective on the technological environment of a worker, but also in focusing on Central and Eastern European labor markets, which are underrepresented in the scholarly literature. Un - derstanding the root causes of fear of automation can inform strategies to mitigate workers ’ concerns and develop organizational cultures that foster human-centered digital transformation. 2. Literature review 2.1. How to conceptualize fear? Fear is an emotion known to every human being. The definition in the American Psychological Association Dictionary [ 7 ] states that fear is “ a basic, intense emotion aroused by the detection of imminent threat, involving an immediate alarm reaction that mobilizes the organism. ” The APA definition goes on to firmly differentiate fear from anxiety: the former is a response to a present and clearly identifiable threat, while the latter is oriented to a distant, uncertain, and more diffuse threat. People react to fear by seeking immediate solutions, while anx - iety necessitates solutions that are broader and more adaptable [ 8 ]. This differentiation inspired the design of our questionnaire (Question 3 was originally designed to measure technological fear, while Question 4 was designed to measure technological anxiety; see Section 4, Table 1 ). Thus, we assumed that fear is connected with concrete mental representa - tions — for example, the possibility of losing one ’ s job in the foreseeable future — while anxiety is associated with distant, ambiguous, and dispersed threats, such as the risk of massive technological unemployment.

{"page_content": "the organism. ” The APA definition goes on to firmly differentiate fear from anxiety: the former is a response to a present and clearly identifiable threat, while the latter is oriented to a distant, uncertain, and more diffuse threat. People react to fear by seeking immediate solutions, while anx - iety necessitates solutions that are broader and more adaptable [ 8 ]. This differentiation inspired the design of our questionnaire (Question 3 was originally designed to measure technological fear, while Question 4 was designed to measure technological anxiety; see Section 4, Table 1 ). Thus, we assumed that fear is connected with concrete mental representa - tions — for example, the possibility of losing one ’ s job in the foreseeable future — while anxiety is associated with distant, ambiguous, and dispersed threats, such as the risk of massive technological unemployment. During the data analysis phase, we encountered recent critical literature in psychology challenging the widely accepted distinction between fear and anxiety and proposing new theoretical assumptions to merge these concepts. Critics such as Daniel-Watanabe and Fletcher [ 9 ] argue that the traditional definition of fear and the differentiation be - tween fear and anxiety — fundamental to categorizing mental disorder - s — are inconsistent and oversimplified. They contend that these flaws stem from contradictory data, which arise due to the direct and often inappropriate application of animal research findings to human behavior. Concurrently, we observed terminological confusion within the literature, as some authors, like McClure [ 10 ] with “ technophobia ” and Agogo [ 11 ] with “ technoparanoia, ” use these terms to describe the fear of job loss due to machines. Technophobia, however, has a defined meaning in information systems literature and is closely related to computer anxiety, which refers to individual apprehension about using technology in daily life. Some authors consistently use the notion of Table 1 Phrasing of the survey questions and the answers. Question Phrasing Answer 1.

{"page_content": "anxiety to refer to fears of machines replacing human labor [ 12 ]. Nevertheless, in recent years an increasing number of empirical studies have applied the notion of “ fear of automation. ” Innocenti and Golin [ 13 ] equate it with the “ perceived risk of unemployment due to auto - mation effects; ” Golin and Rauh [ 6 ] describe it as a “ response to a perceived threat of job loss because of automation; ” and Mulas-Granados et al. [ 14 ] open their paper by stating that “ the fear of automation is turning into the collective angst of our times, ” implicitly defining it as a “ negative perception of how automation will shape the future of their own work. ” Similarly, Långstedt et al. [ 15 ] assert that “ advanced technologies are changing our working life in unpredictable ways. Consequently, a fear of technologically induced mass unemploy - ment has re-emerged. ” Given this growing body of work, we chose to consolidate techno - logical fear and anxiety into a unified concept: fear of automation. We connected this concept with job insecurity, a well-established theme in the sociology of work [ 16 ] (see Section 4.1 Description of measures ). We align with LeDoux ’ s succinct definition of fear as the “ conscious awareness that you are in harm ’ s way ” (Le Doux as cited in Ref. [ 17 ]), with the specific harm here being the risk of job loss to machines. In this way, fear of automation encompasses not only individual concerns about one ’ s labor being replaced by automation technologies but also broader worries about technological unemployment. 2.2. Fear in late modernity Building on the psychological differentiation between fear and anxiety, we now turn to a sociological perspective that views fear as an integral part of social life in late modernity. Adopting a comprehensive the notion of fear of automation allows us to move beyond an overly psychological framework and enhance our understanding with insights from the emerging sociology of fear. Seen through sociological lenses, the ways and practices of fear are inherently social, shaped by cultural patterns of interactions, relations, structures, discourses, and imaginaries. Fear and society co-create each other: on the one hand, “ society, in its different figurations, affective constellations, and various mechanisms, is involved in producing, forming, and representing fear ” ([ 18 ]: 276). On the other hand, fear reproduces society, serving as an integration mechanism: when we fear something, we may unite to confront it or acknowledge a shared pre - dicament. The sociological approach to fear considers not just an indi - vidual emotion but also the cultural matrix within which fear is realized [ 19 ]. The sociology of fear suggests that while fear has always been pre - sent in social life, it has assumed particular significance in late modern societies. Tudor ([ 19 ]: 238) observes that “ fearfulness appears to have become a way of life in modern society, ” an observation supported by Sik [ 20 ], who describes fear as “ a phenomenological texture of late modernity. ” Bauman [ 21 ] introduces the concept of “ liquid fear, ” a constant sensation experienced by reflexive individuals aware of their vulnerability to unseen dangers in modern society. Other leading theo - rists of late modernity, like Beck and Giddens, link fear to the extensive scale, scope, and impact of socioeconomic and cultural transformations, emphasizing its amplification due to dwindling social trust — a conse - quence of deteriorating social integration mechanisms in late capitalism [ 22 ]. In this context, technological revolutions that reshape the labor market are seen as specific generators of an objectified fear that one ’ s job may be usurped by intelligent machines. Furedi [ 23 ] suggests that the fear of automation is fueled by the rapid pace of technological progress, which exacerbates the feeling of a lack of control over the social and economic consequences of technology adoption. Furedi also notes that the prevalence of fear in contemporary society is partly driven by deliberate actions of those who benefit from it. He describes a culture of fear crafted by “ fear entrepreneurs, ” who cultivate a discourse of fear within “ markets of fear. ” Fear of automation is a case in point [ 24 ]. For decades, the fear of automation has been flared up by publications arguing that technology and automation signal the end of mass employment [ 25 ]. The now-canonical definition of technological unemployment was proposed almost 100 years ago by John Maynard Keynes, who described it as the phenomenon where technology advances faster than the economy ’ s ability to generate new jobs. Keynes warned that this could lead to widespread economic dislocation and social unrest if new employment opportunities were not created swiftly enough.

Keynes warned that this could lead to widespread economic dislocation and social unrest if new employment opportunities were not created swiftly enough. In the 1990s, Aronowitz and DiFazio [ 26 ] warned of a “ jobless future, ” and Rifkin [ 27 ] ominously discussed the “ end of work. ” More recently, Suskind [ 2 ] worried about a world without work and Ford [ 28 ] revisited the concept of a “ jobless future. ” However persuasive, their narratives were painted with broad strokes of essayistic fervor. This is why it can be argued that the paper by Frey and Osborne [ 29 ], provocatively titled “ The Future of Employment: How susceptible are jobs to computerization, ” had the most significant impact on the fearmongering discourse regarding technological unem - ployment. These two Oxford economists anchored the fear of automa - tion to a specific and quite alarming figure, claiming that nearly half (47 %) of all jobs were at risk of “ computerization. ” Their methodology has drawn significant criticism for overestimating technology ’ s potential and neglecting the earlier approach developed by Harvard economists Autor, Levy, and Murnane [ 30 ], which proposed assessing the risk of automation based on specific tasks or clusters of tasks within pro - fessions, rather than evaluating entire occupations. From this perspec - tive, in some areas, humans will enhance machine functions through training, interpreting, and maintaining them, while in others, machines will boost human capacities, reducing the need for humans to perform mundane or risky tasks [ 31, 32 ]. The impact will not be so much the replacement of humans by machines as the complementing of human work by machine work, and vice versa, introducing a new division of labor without resulting in massive technological unemployment in the foreseeable future [ 33 ]. Nevertheless, Osborne and Frey ’ s assertive claims caught the atten - tion of influential fear entrepreneurs, particularly in the media. The BBC even developed an app allowing readers to check if robots could replace their jobs. Major consulting firms began producing reports forecasting massive job losses, creating a lucrative market of fear. For instance, a 2018 McKinsey report suggested that 375 million workers — about 14 percent of the global workforce — might need to switch occupational categories due to digitalization, automation, and AI advances [ 34 ]. As of 2024, the alarmist tone continues, with reports indicating that 12 million US workers alone may need to change jobs [ 35 ]. 2.3. Who is vulnerable to automation? Recent literature on the impact of automation technologies on overall employment offers no consistent evidence [ 36 – 39 ]. However, a balanced yet slightly optimistic view seems to prevail among labor market economists. In a comprehensive review of 127 empirical articles published between 1988 and 2021, H ¨otte et al. [ 40 ] concluded that massive technological unemployment is unlikely, as job creation from technological progress usually offsets job losses. Economic theory sug - gests that compensatory mechanisms, such as new roles and increased productivity, support labor demand in non-automated sectors. Addi - tionally, technological innovation can boost labor demand by lowering production costs and consumer prices, potentially increasing output if demand rises due to higher income and lower prices [ 41 ]. While economists generally agree that massive technological un - employment is unlikely, they also recognize that technology ’ s impact on the labor market will not be uniformly positive. In fact, technological changes are skill-biased [ 42, 43 ] — both complementary and substitution effects occur simultaneously, but in relation to different groups of workers. Intelligent machines and systems complement the work of highly competent individuals, but may also exacerbate exclusion in R. W ł och et al.

{"page_content": "labor markets, particularly among low-skill, production, and manufacturing workers. This can lead to a potential widening of the pay and status gap between different worker groups [ 44 ]. The number of positions in which harmonious complementarity between human and machine work can occur is actually limited, and workers whose employers want to pair them with machines generally possess such high competencies that they need not fear unemployment anyway [ 28 ]. Brynjolfsson and McAfee [ 45 ] highlights that employment security will be available to workers with a specific competence profile. Stephany and Teutloff [ 46 ] further reinforce the importance of skills and their complementarity in the context of AI-driven technological change. They find that skills that can be broadly complemented in diverse set - tings are associated with higher value, especially in the case of increased demand and applicability of AI skills. A significant impact of Osborne and Frey’s [ 29 ] publication was its authoritative identification of specific worker groups particularly vulnerable to the current automation phase: those in routine work. Routine work involves tasks that follow a clear, step-by-step procedure, whether physical or cognitive, and can be performed by workers at all skill levels, but is predominant among medium-skilled workers. Ac - cording to their analysis, 47 % of the U.S. jobs are exposed to comput - erization, with the estimated automation risk for some traditionally secure white-collar jobs—including accountants, cashiers, bank customer service representatives, and sales administrators—reaching as high as 97 %. However, using a different, task-based, approach, Arntz, Gregory, and Zierahn [ 47 ] label only 9 % of jobs in OECD countries as automatable, while Nedelkoska and Quintini [ 48 ] demonstrate that 14 % of jobs are at high risk, with another 32 % facing significant changes due to automation. The differences in estimates between such studies were scrutinized by Lorenz et al. [ 49 ]. While they confirme that routine, computer-based tasks are more likely to be affected by automation, they also highlight the importance of within-occupation task heterogeneity and the selection of models employed to estimate automation risk. Bi - nary models, like the one used by Frey and Osborne [ 29 ], which classify jobs as either high-risk or not, tend to overestimate the share of auto - matable jobs, when compared to studies utilizing fractional models, so models that yield a more detailed range of automation probabilities (such as Ref. [ 48 ]). This is because the binary models are sensitive to the threshold used to define high automation risk and produce bimodal distribution. In contrast, the distribution of automation risks in frac - tional models is bell-shaped, where the majority occupations fall be - tween the extremes of low and high automation probability [ 49 ]. The focus on the impact of technology on employment, especially in routine tasks, has been expanded under the concept of routine-biased technological change by researchers such as Goos et al. [ 50 ]. Although debates persist over the precise definition of routineness and how to categorize tasks as routine or non-routine, the theory suggests signifi - cant shifts in the labor market. Autor [ 51 ] notes that employment in middle-skill occupations, which have the highest percentage of routine tasks, is declining relative to positions in low- and high-skill jobs. This phenomenon is referred to as job polarization. Furthermore, as demand for routine activities decreases, the returns to these tasks also diminish [ 52, 53 ]. Additionally, recent developments in artificial intelligence gradually expand the assumptions of the routine task-based approach. As algo - rithms are becoming capable of solving problems requiring “tacit” knowledge, the spectrum of codifiable activities broadens, encompass - ing non-routine cognitive and creative tasks. Such advances may affect different groups of workers, mainly highly skilled individuals who have not previously been adversely affected or threatened [ 51 ], potentially raising the level of fear of losing their job to increasingly potent digital machines. Interestingly, there seem to be no consensus as to who is more en - dangered by automation, men or women. For instance, Lorenz et al. [ 49 ] report that gender has no significant effect on automation risk, whereas Nedelkoska and Quintini [ 48 ] argue that women face a higher risk. Supporting the latter view, Roberts et al. [ 54 ] show that women can be twice as affected by automation, as they work in more routine-suffused jobs. Blanas et al. [ 55 ] contend that software and robots have reduced demand for low- and medium-skill workers, the young, and women in manufacturing, but increased demand for high-skill, older workers, and men in services.

This supports the theory that automation replaces routine tasks, with some workers, especially women, transitioning away from these roles. Yet in her analysis of 10 key books on the future of work published between 2018 and 2020, Kelan [ 56 ] found that their authors are concerned about automation of jobs and tasks performed by man, particularly those who are middle-aged and low-skilled. Based on data for Canadian workers, Petersen et al. [ 57 ] also state that, with some exceptions, occupations characterized by low income and high employment of men are more susceptible to automation risk, particu - larly in some industry sectors. More specifically, Filippi et al. [ 58 ] find that European women face a slightly lower risk of substitution due to automation compared to men. However, in institutional contexts with higher gender equality, women tend to acquire non-automatable skills, which further decreases their risk of substitution. Similarly, there is no consensus on the specific vulnerability of workers in different age groups to automation. At first glance, older workers appear more vulnerable to automation [ 59, 60 ], but Nedelkoska and Quintini’s [ 48 ] novel finding challenges this view. Their research shows that while the relationship between automation and age is U-shaped, jobs held by teenagers are at the highest risk. In general, it is important to emphasize the lack of consensus in the scholarly literature regarding the specific factors determining the risk of automation, as meticulously described by Filippi et al. [ 58 ], who note that “the literature investigating how automation technologies affect employment is extremely complex, uncertain, and immature,” and that the empirical results “are often inconsistent, creating uncertainty in the literature.” This immaturity makes the formulation of hypotheses in our study more challenging. At the same time, it highlights the need for both conceptual effort and the empirical accumulation of results, both of which are addressed in our study, representing another small step to - ward the maturation of the literature on automation’s impact on the labor market. 2.4. What determines fear of automation? The literature reviewed thus far generally suggests that fear of automation is most likely experienced by less-skilled workers and those engaged in routine tasks. In this section, we explore the relatively few empirical studies that specifically examine which groups are particularly fearful of automation. 2.4.1. Exposure to technology Several studies have explored how exposure to technology influences the development of automation fear. For example, although Klenert et al. [ 38 ] convincingly shows that robot use leads to an increase in aggregate employment in Europe, Mulas-Granados et al. [ 14 ] find that higher robot penetration increases people’s apprehension toward tech - nology. This is especially evident in the large-scale manufacturing and automotive sectors, where human labor is being noticeably replaced by robots [ 44, 48 ]. In their study on the determinants of robot acceptance at work, Turja and Oksanen [ 61 ] observe that while countries with higher ICT exports and more cellular phones per capita demonstrated greater acceptance of robots, higher job-automation risks correlated with lower acceptance levels. There is no agreement regarding whether awareness of automation risk leads to increased job insecurity. Nazareno and Schiff [ 62 ] find no direct relation between awareness of automation risk, job insecurity, and the lessened well-being of workers. On the other hand, Innocenti and Golin [ 13 ] argue that workers aware of automatability exhibit increased concerns about being replaced, a sentiment echoed by Yam et al. [ 63 ], who find that anticipation of robotic integration heightens R. Włoch et al.

{"page_content": "job insecurity across all skill levels. Similarly, Dengler and Gundert [ 64 ] observe that workers in vulnerable occupations feel job insecurity even without personal experience with robots. Ligmont and Alexiou [ 65 ] extend this understanding by demonstrating that mere awareness of automation technologies in authoritarian organizational cultures particularly heightens employees’ perceptions of job insecurity. 2.4.2. Sense of control Willcocks ([ 25 ]: 297–298) broadly asserts that the fear of automa - tion has \"always been a psychological repository for some of our deepest anxieties, about future uncertainties and loss of control, including over our own creations.” Significantly, individuals who believe in their ability to control their own lives and maintain freedom of choice tend to experience less anxiety about automation [ 13 ]. Interestingly, Di Nuzzi and Santoni [ 66 ] argue that fear of automation may stem from the feeling of a lack of direct control over machines. Admittedly, the sense of control over one’s life may play the role of an anxiety buffer when facing the threat of automation [ 67 ]. Godollei and Beck [ 68 ] offer a general proposition that “people in jobs, industries, countries, or economic po - sitions which afford them little control are more likely to be susceptible to fearful reactions”. Their study shows that how much control people feel they have over automation strongly influences whether they see it as a threat to their job security or an opportunity to improve their work performance. 2.4.3. Labor market position Several studies highlight that fear of automation, and more gener - ally, technology-related job insecurity is linked with weaker labor market positions [ 69 ]. McClure [ 10 ] find that fear of robots, AI, and new technology, which he proposes to call technophobia, is strongly related to concerns over job security and financial instability. The study shows that technophobia prevails more among women, non-White minorities, and less educated individuals, pointing to a connection between auto - mation fears, automation vulnerability (see Section 2.3 ), and socio-educational inequalities. Importantly, from the perspective of fear treated as a phenomenon specific for late capitalism, technophobes often report anxiety-related mental health issues, suggesting that such fears could contribute to a vicious cycle of escalating anxiety, particularly regarding employment and financial wellbeing. Innocenti and Golin [ 13 ] also find that women, younger workers, and low-income earners are more likely to fear unemployment due to automation. Mulas-Granados et al. [ 14 ], using data on 11,000 workers from both advanced and emerging economies, assert that “negative perceptions about automation are prevalent among workers who are older, poorer, more exposed to job volatility, and from countries with higher robot penetrations”. Similarly, Ghimire et al. [ 70 ], interpreting the results of the survey in Atlanta, state that automation is feared more by older and poorer residents, as well as Black/African Americans. Provocatively, they conclude that those who did not take the risk of automation into account – less-educated and Hispanics or Latinos – are more likely to lose their jobs. Interestingly, Shoss [ 16 ] notes that workers in societies with greater overall inequality tend to see AI and robots as more threatening. The scholarly literature does not present a consensus on the rela - tionship between a worker’s age and their apprehensions regarding automation. Generally, the relationship between age and job insecurity due to automation is described as U-shaped, with variations noted in different studies [ 14, 64 ]. Several studies suggest that older workers, presumably due to more stabilized work positions, tend to be less afraid of automation [ 6, 13 ]. On the other hand research led by Ivanov et al. [ 71 ] lends partial support to the hypothesis that younger individuals, likely due to their ease with technology, are less fearful of job displacement by machines.

Research hypotheses Our study design allows us to analyze how workers perceive tech - nology’s impact on their roles, specifically whether it substitutes for or complements their tasks. We aim to test the hypothesis that fear of automation increases among workers who have experienced changes in their job functions due to technological advancements. Drawing from routine-biased technological change theory, we investigate whether workers in roles with a higher proportion of routine tasks exhibit greater fear of automation. Additionally, we examine the relationship between overall exposure to technology within a sector and the level of fear experienced by workers. Building on insights from our literature review, we hypothesize that fear of automation is heightened among workers who are structurally more vulnerable due to their precarious position in the labor market. Furthermore, we propose examining whether a sense of control over one’s life acts as a buffer against fear of automation, aligning our dis - cussion with the broader discourse on fear as a fundamental aspect of the contemporary human condition. To determine the factors shaping fear of automation, we test the following hypotheses inspired by the literature review. H1. A higher fear of automation is related to experiencing changes in work tasks due to the introduction of automation technologies. In other words, if a worker has already experienced their tasks being substituted or complemented by new technologies, the fear of automation is higher. In line with the literature review, we expect that the fear of automation will be greater when tasks are substituted rather than complemented. H2. The more routine tasks a given job involves, the higher fear of automation. H3. Fear of automation is higher the more intense workers’ exposure to technology within their sector. H4. Workers who perceive a greater lack of control over their lives exhibit a higher fear of automation. H5. A higher fear of automation is related to a weaker position in the labor market, as defined by gender, age, education, and income. 4. Data and methods The study uses data collected as part of the deliberately designed Central European Social Survey, conducted via the Computer-Assisted Web Interviewing (CAWI) method. The survey encompassed 11,000 individuals across six European Union countries: Austria, Czechia, Germany, Hungary, Poland, and Slovakia. The data collection period spanned from December 2021 to January 2022. To ensure a represen - tative sample, a random quota sampling procedure was employed, meticulously reflecting each country’s demographic composition among adults aged 18 and above. This procedure accounted for gender, age categories, and the size of the respondents’ place of residence. For the purposes of our analyses, we confine our sample to in - dividuals actively engaged in the workforce. This includes full-time workers, part-time workers, interns, individuals on maternal or R.

To see the percentage distribu - tion of gender, age, and place of residence among the confined sample; see Table A1 in the Appendix. Of the six countries covered, Austria and Germany are the most heavily represented, while Slovakia has the lowest representation. Among our respondents, 61 % hail from Central and Eastern European (CEE) countries, namely Poland, Hungary, Czechia, and Slovakia. The gender distribution is roughly balanced, with 53 % of respondents being male. The majority (80 %) fall within the age range of 18 – 54, with a mean age of 43 years. In terms of educational attainment, 40 % of workers graduated from upper-secondary school, while the remainder is nearly equally divided between those with primary or lower-secondary education and those with tertiary education. Regarding occupation, the most common roles among our respondents are Clerks (24 %), followed by Service workers and shop and market sales workers (19 %), Professionals (16 %), and Technicians and associate professionals (11 %). The largest proportion of respondents works in the \"Other Services Activities\" sector (14 %), followed by Manufacturing (13 %), Human Health and Social Work Activities (9 %), and Education (7 %). For detailed information on oc - cupations and sectors, see Table A2 in the Appendix. The perceptions of new technologies at work — a broad term relating to information systems, specialized software, algorithms, and robotic solutions — were probed through four questions presented in the Table 1. The first question addressed recent experiences with new technologies in the workplace, asking whether they were complementary (answer 2), substitutive (3 or 4) or had no impact on job tasks (answer 1). In the second question, respondents were asked about their job insecurity. The third surveyed beliefs regarding the automation potential of a worker ’ s current job tasks. The last question inquired workers ’ beliefs about automation-induced mass technological unemployment. The time frame for Question 2, 3, and 4 spans the next ten years (see Table 1 ), and these three questions are used to construct our measure of fear of automation, as explained further in Section 4.1. Before the development of the Central European Social Survey, which took place at the turn of the years 2020 and 2021, only a few studies had explored the theme of automation fears (e.g., [ 69,73 – 75 ]). As all the studies employed different questionnaires, there was no established standard in place for surveying people about their concerns regarding automation. The phrasing of our Questions 2 and 3 drew from the items developed by Brougham and Haar [ 74 ], whose focus encom - passed a wider array of technologies in the context of automation, forming our umbrella term “ new technologies ”, which refers to infor - mation systems, specialized software, algorithms, and robots. We fol - lowed their approach of disentangling questions on automation perceptions from job insecurity to identify workers who fear both automation and job loss, as well as those who expect automation without feeling job insecurity and vice versa. Furthermore, we added a time frame to our questions to increase the precision of the responses as automation technologies continuously expand their spectrum of capa - bilities. Later studies, such as by Innocenti and Golin [ 13 ], or Arntz et al. [ 76 ], similarly introduced time frames, which validate our approach. 4.1. Description of measures The main measure of interest in this study — fear of automa - tion — synthesizes the second, third, and fourth questions. The answers to these questions take values on a 5-point Likert scale, ranging from 1 (I strongly disagree) to 5 (I strongly agree), with 3 (I neither agree nor disagree) as the midpoint (see Table 1 ). Following the method of Dekker et al. [ 69 ], we calculate the mean value of the answers to these ques - tions, resulting in a scale from 1 to 5. The lowest values depict workers who are not afraid of losing their job in the profession, do not expect their job tasks to be automated, and do not foresee mass technological unemployment. The highest values cover workers expecting job loss, automation, and mass technological unemployment. For the purpose of further analyses allowing us to contextualize factors determining fear of automation, we construct three measures: (a) Workplace technology experience, which relates to direct individual experience with technology within their job duties; (b) Routine Task Intensity (RTI), which depicts how routine (repetitive, procedural) workers ’ job tasks are; and (c) Technology exposure, which refers to overall exposure to industrial robots within the respective sector.

The categorical variable Workplace technology experience is derived from Question 1 (see Table 1 ), and is used here to attest whether workers declare no impact of technology on their work (answer 1); a comple - mentary effect, when technology supports them in performing their job tasks (answer 2); or a substitutive effect, when they feel that technology increasingly replaces them in their job tasks (answers 3 and 4). Since our dataset lacks the information needed to construct our own Routine Task Intensity measure, we develop the measure using the OECD Survey of Adult Skills (PIAAC, 2012), guided by the task-based methodology of De La Rica et al. [ 53 ]. We then match the constructed measure to our dataset on the country-occupational level. Hence, each worker in our survey is assigned a RTI measure from PIAAC based on their occupation and country of living. Other task-based methodologies often rely on the US-focused data - bases, such as the Dictionary of Occupational Titles or the Occupational Information Network (e.g., [ 77 ], [ 42 ]), which may not always capture the occupational task structures in other countries. Hence, the advan - tage of using the approach of De La Rica et al. [ 53 ] lies in ensuring cross-country heterogeneity of task measures. The validity of their approach was confirmed through statistical comparison with the O*NET measures as computed by Acemoglu and Autor [ 42 ], demonstrating significant positive correlations for the United States (notably the highest) as well as for other countries. Yet, the correlations for other countries differ, indicating a varying occupational task structure be - tween countries [ 53 ] and the need to account for it. The PIAAC dataset provides information on specific job tasks at an individual level, which we group into Abstract, Routine, and Manual tasks — a categorization necessary to construct the RTI measure. Abstract tasks involve complex cognitive activities requiring problem-solving, decision-making, social skills, or applying specialized knowledge. Routine tasks consist of repetitive and rule-based activities, which are measured here as the infrequency of tasks requiring autonomy, such as planning one ’ s own activities, instructing and advising other people, or making speeches. Manual tasks involve working physically for extended periods or tasks requiring accuracy with hands or fingers. Table A3 in the Appendix presents the exact method of grouping the PIAAC ques - tions into these categories as proposed by De La Rica et al. [ 53 ]. Within these three groups, responses to each question were provided on a 5-point scale indicating the frequency of performing a particular task. To derive a single measure for each task group, we conduct Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the Abstract and Routine task groups, and use the first PCA components for further analyses. In line with the methodology of De La Rica et al. (2020), we calculate the average for the Manual tasks, given that this category comprises only two items. Having single measures for Abstract, Routine, and Manual tasks, we calculate Routine Task Intensity (RTI) in accordance with Goos et al. ’ s [ 50 ] formula: RTI = ln ( RoutineTasks ) \u0000 ( ln ( AbstractTasks ) + ln ( ManualTasks )) on a pooled dataset of the six analyzed countries. We calculate the means for ISCO 2-digit classification of occupations for each country, except for Austria, for which data is available only on the broadest level of aggregation (ISCO 1-digit). To tackle this issue, the measures for Austria were derived as the average of the other investigated countries ’ occupational measures. We match the calculated RTI from PIAAC with our survey using ISCO 2-digit occupational classification and country. The matched RTI measure is then standardized. R. W ł och et al.

{"page_content": "To obtain the Technology exposure measure, we use two datasets. The International Federation of Robotics (IFR) data provides informa - tion on the number of industrial robots operating in a given sector, country, and year. The data on the number of workers in a certain country-sector in 2020 was acquired from Eurostat ’ s Labour Force Survey. Following de Vries et al. [ 78 ], we calculate the Technology exposure as the number of the operational stock of industrial robots (R) per one thousand workers (EMP) in country-sector pairs for 2020: Technology Exposure c, s = R c, s EMP c, s The sectoral matching between our dataset, Eurostat ’ s Labour Force Survey and the calculated is presented in Table A4, Appendix. Similarly to Routine Task Intensity, the Technology exposure measure is standardized. In addition to demographic variables such as gender, age, income, education, and country of residence, we include a variable assessing the perception of personal control over life events. The measure of the Perceived lack of control is based on a question worded: “ Currently, I have a feeling that many things are happening in my life over which I have no influence ”, with responses ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree). Higher values signify a decreasing sense of control over one ’ s own life. 4.2. Empirical specification This study ’ s main empirical approach focuses on the determinants of fear of automation. The construction of this measure enables the use of the OLS regression method. The model takes the following form: y i, o, s, c = α + β 1 Work_tech_experience i + β 2 RTI o, c + β 3 Tech_exposure s, c + β 4 Control i + β 5 X i + ϵ i where y i, o, s, c denotes the measure of the fear of automation of an indi - vidual i in occupation o, who works in sector s of country c. Work tech experience i represents an individual ’ s Workplace technology experience (either complementary or substitutive). RTI o, c refers to the Routine Task Intensity measure for occupation o in country c and Tech exposure s, c covers exposure to robots in sector s of country c. Control i captures the Perceived lack of control over one ’ s life. X i is a vector of controls for gender, age, education, wage quintile, and country fixed effects. To address the issues arising from different levels of ag - gregation among independent variables, we employ clustered standard errors for occupations (ISCO 1-digit, 10 clusters) and sectors (NACE 1- digit, 21 clusters). 4.2.1. Robustness The modeling approach outlined above presents two challenges to unbiased identification: potential self-selection into occupations with various levels of automation exposure and confounding effects related to perceived lack of control. Specifically, certain groups of workers are more likely to self-select into occupations with specific levels of auto - mation exposure, as reflected by occupational Routine Task Intensity. For instance, men, highly educated individuals with advanced skills, and high-wage earners tend to be employed in less automatable jobs ([ 48 ]; for more details, see Section 2.3. Who is vulnerable to automation?). Similarly, workers ’ characteristics — such as age, wage, gender, or edu - cation — can influence their sense of control [ 79 ]. Given that fear of automation is also shaped by these factors, confounding arises in rela - tion to workers ’ characteristics. To address these identification threats, we employ the Inverse Probability Weighting (IPW) method with respect to Routine Task Intensity and Perceived lack of control. IPW is a statistical technique widely used to mitigate potential biases in observational studies by introducing weights that generate a pseudo- population. Within this pseudo-population, the variable of interest (often referred to as the treatment) and selection are independent of covariates, enabling more reliable estimation of its effect on the outcome variable. In essence, each observation is assigned a weight based on the inverse of the probability (or propensity score) of receiving the treat - ment or being selected, given the covariates. By applying these weights, the treated and untreated groups in the reweighted population achieve similar covariate distributions. This reduces self-selection and con - founding by mimicking a randomized experiment [ 80 ]. The application of IPW involves several steps. First, the covariates for the Propensity Score (PS) model — the model explaining the treatment variable, i.e., RTI and Perceived lack of control — are identified based on insights from theory and relevant literature (e.g., [ 47,48,58,79 ]). In our study, the hypothesized individual covariates associated with self-selection into occupations with varying levels of automation", "metadata": {"producer": "Acrobat Distiller 8.1.0 (Windows)", "creator": "Elsevier", "creationdate": "2025-04-25T16:49:12+00:00", "crossmarkdomains[1]": "elsevier.com", "crossmarkmajorversiondate": "2010-04-23", "creationdate--text": "26th April 2025", "elsevierwebpdfspecifications": "7.0.1", "robots": "noindex", "moddate": "2025-04-26T11:29:44+00:00", "author": "Renata Włoch", "doi": "10.1016/j.techsoc.2024.102782", "title": "Who's afraid of automation?

In our study, the hypothesized individual covariates associated with self-selection into occupations with varying levels of automation expo - sure (RTI) include gender, age, education, and wage. The same set of confounders is introduced when estimating the PS model for Perceived lack of control. In both PS models, we also account for the country of origin. In the second step, the PS model is estimated using a method suitable for the nature of the treatment variable. Then, the IPWs are derived using a formula consistent with the modeling approach. Since our var - iables of interest are continuous, we apply the IPW method for contin - uous variables as proposed formally by Naimi et al. [ 81 ] and implemented in R using the ipw package by Heiss [ 82 ]. The formula we use is as follows: IPW = f x ( X; μ 1, σ 2 1 ) f x | C ( X | C = c; μ 2, σ 2 2 ), where X is the continuous treat - ment variable, C denotes confounders, the numerator is the probability density function of X, and the denominator is the conditional probability density function of X given C. We apply the formula to two variables, yielding two sets of IPWs: one balancing the covariates for RTI, and the other balancing the covariates for the Perceived lack of control. To obtain a single weight, we multiply the IPWs calculated for these two variables of interest. Third, extreme weights are inspected and addressed to improve the accuracy of the estimates [ 80,81,83,84 ]. We trim extreme weight values by replacing those below the 1st percentile with the 1st percentile value and those above the 99th percentile with the 99th percentile value. Next, the balance of covariates across different treatment levels is assessed. To ensure that the covariates are balanced for the combined weight, we examine two balance tables: one for RTI and one for the Perceived lack of control. Both tables indicate that the covariates are balanced for the variables of interest, using 0.05 as the maximum allowable threshold for the absolute value of the balance measure (following Bishop et al. [ 80 ]). This suggests that confounding issues are mitigated in the outcome model. For more details, see the balance tables in Table 2. Finally, having obtained the combined weights that balance the covariates for both RTI and Perceived sense of control, we apply them to the econometric models as a robustness check. 5. Results 5.1. Fear of automation: Descriptive The measure of fear of automation takes values from 1 to 5. Fig. 1 A displays the distribution of the measure among our respondents. We establish a threshold score of 3.67 or above to identify workers who fear automation, as this reflects individuals who must at least \"rather agree\" with two of the three components of the measure. Considering this, our analysis reveals that 15.9 % of workers experience fear of automation, as illustrated in Fig. 1 B. This finding concurrently implies that the majority of workers are not afraid. This is echoed in the measure ’ s mean of 2.71 and median of 2.67. The relationships between the components of the measure of fear of automation are positive and statistically significant. As calculated using Gamma measure of association for ordinal variables, the association is the strongest between job insecurity and belief in technological R. W ł och et al.

Hence, workers appear to often provide similar answers to these pairs of questions. To illustrate this, Fig. 2 shows the distribution of responses and the per - centage of transitions between these two pairs of questions. 17.2 % of respondents are convinced that they will lose their job within 10 years, and 25.9 % believe that their tasks can be automated. One-third envisions mass technological unemployment (see Fig. 2 ). At the same time, half of the workers fearing job loss are convinced that their tasks can be automated, and 63.1% — that technology and auto - mation will lead to mass unemployment in the future (see Fig. 2 ). More surprisingly, only one-third of people who expect task automation or mass unemployment fear losing their job (see Fig. 2 ). Unsurprisingly, there are individuals who believe in the progress of task automation and its detrimental effect on society while not fearing job loss, as well as workers who fear job loss regardless of automation (see Fig. 2 ). The majority, however, offers similar answers to both pairs of questions. To see the exact cross-tabulation of the unaggregated re - sponses to survey questions used to construct the fear of automation measure, refer to Appendix Figure A1. An examination of correlations between the continuous variables of interest reveals that fear of automation is positively associated with Routine Task Intensity and Technology exposure, as displayed in Table 4. Similarly, when the Perceived lack of control rises, so does fear of automation. We consider several factors that could explain the differences in fear of automation (see Table 5 ). Workers who have already experienced automation constitute the only group with the average fear measure that exceeds 3. Young adults (18 – 34), workers in the 1st wage quintile, and primary school graduates score not far behind (all around 2.85). Also, the measure ’ s mean decreases as wages increase. Employees in Central and Eastern European countries report notably higher levels of fear, with Slovakia and Poland topping the list. Men score lower on average than women (see Table 5 ). 5.2. Determinants of fear of automation Table 6 displays the results of our modeling approach described in Section 4.2. Empirical specification. The models are estimated for the sample covered by the Technology exposure measure (N = 6607). Models (1) and (2) are estimated without weights, while Models (3) and (4) incorporate Inverse Probability Weights, as described in Section 4.2.1. Robustness. In the first model (Model (1)), we focus only on the main variables of interest: Workplace technology experience, Routine Task Intensity, Technology exposure, and Perceived lack of control. This allows us to isolate the direct relationships between these variables and fear of automation without the impact of covariates. In the second model (Model (2)), we add control variables that ac - count for workers ’ labor market position (gender, age, education, wage quintile) and country fixed effects, which help address the omitted variable bias. By comparing the estimates between Models (1) and (2), we observe low variability in the coefficients, suggesting that the core relationships are robust. However, as we are aware of issues related to self-selection and confounding with respect to RTI, Perceived lack of control and control variables (see Section 4.2.1. Robustness), we apply the combined Inverse Probability Weights to Model (3) and Model (4). Again, when we compare the estimates between the models, the vari - ability is not high; however, there are shifts suggesting that confounding may be reduced through weighting. This makes Model (4), which rein - troduces the control variables, our preferred specification for hypothesis testing. As described in detail below, the obtained results support the ma - jority of the hypotheses formulated in the study (see Section 3 Research hypotheses and Table 6 ).

{"page_content": "H1. supported. Any workplace technology experience, whether complementary or substitutive, correlates with higher levels of fear of automation compared to workers who report no impact of technology on their job, by 0.13 and 0.64, respectively (see Table 6, Model (4)). Hence, higher fear of automation is related to technology-induced changes in work tasks, with the experience of task substitution having a more pronounced effect on this fear. H2. supported. The more routine tasks a job involves, the higher the fear of automation. Specifically, for each one standard deviation increase in Routine Task Intensity, fear of automation rises by 0.07 (see Table 6, Model (4)). H3. supported. Fear of automation is higher the more intensive worker exposure to robots within a sector. There is a positive association be - tween increased exposure to technology and the level of fear: a one standard deviation increase in the Technology exposure relates to a 0.02 increase in the measure of fear (see Table 6, Model (4)). H4. supported. Employees declaring greater lack of control over events in their lives exhibit higher fear of automation. One level up the scale of Perceived lack of control is associated with a 0.05 increase in the level of fear of automation (see Table 6, Model (4)). H5. partially supported. Higher fear of automation is related to a weaker position in the labor market for younger workers and those with lower income and education. While gender does not play a significant role in determining fear of automation, the relationship with age is negative (see Table 6, Model (4)). Moreover, higher educational levels are associated with lower levels of fear of automation. Upper-secondary and tertiary education levels decrease the fear by 0.13 and 0.19, respectively, compared to primary and lower-secondary education as the reference level. Wages demonstrate an inverse relationship with the fear. 5.3.

{"page_content": "in academic literature, include its dependence on internet access — excluding those without online connectivity — and the unsu - pervised nature of responses, potentially compromising data reliability. Despite these challenges, CAWI ’ s strength lies in its efficiency in quickly gathering data from a wide respondent base. The key limitation of this study is its dependence on survey data from a select group of European countries. Future research should expand its scope to include a wider array of countries to enhance the generaliz - ability of the results across the European economy, or to enable grounded cross-national comparisons that consider various stages of economic development. Moreover, there is a pressing need for longitu - dinal research to observe the progression of attitudes toward automa - tion, especially as technological progress accelerates. This article does not thoroughly explore the causal factors behind the differing levels of automation fear observed across countries. Addressing this deficiency calls for detailed case studies that factor in the unique aspects of labor markets and the impact of public policy measures. Additionally, while the initial sample of respondents is representative in terms of gender, age, and place of residence ’ s size, the sampling procedure did not ac - count for the occupational structures of the studied countries. Hence, the generalizability of the results is limited after restricting the sample to working individuals. When interpreting and applying the results, one should consider the occupational structure described in Table A2 in the Appendix. 6. Discussion Our study shows that approximately one in six workers fears auto - mation. The literature offers various explanations of this fact, from most radical to quite optimistic. Perhaps fear of automation is like fear of death: so many buffers guard us from experiencing it that we forget to fear the inevitable march onward by the machines [ 67 ]. Or maybe people tend to associate automation risk with other people ’ s jobs, not their own, and remain unconcerned even when directly threatened by automation [ 62 ]. The argument might also favor Khogali and Mehid [ 24 ], who claim that the overall impact of AI on employment is likely to be positive. However, we maintain that in our technologized society, amid the rapid development of Generative Artificial Intelligence, fear of automation will grow, driven by media hype and the narrative of ubiquitous consulting firms, making research on its determinants a necessity. We make several contributions to the literature on the fear of auto - mation and, more broadly, to research on technology ’ s impact on the labor market. First, we propose an original approach to the conceptu - alization of fear of automation. As evidenced in the suggested con - struction of our measure, we emphasize that such fear is a social phenomenon, deeply embedded in the economic context. The way we study and describe technologically stimulated transformations in the labor market, as an academic community, also becomes an element of the social perception of fear. We do not assert that this conceptualization is definitive or exhaustive; instead, we view it as a contribution to ongoing discussions and encourage other researchers to critique and expand upon it. Second, our analysis of the factors determining the fear of automa - tion shows the importance of occupational task structure and exposure to technology, thereby validating insights by Dengler and Gundert [ 64 ], Innocenti and Golin [ 13 ] and Mulas-Granados et al. [ 14 ]. The percep - tion that technologies are replacing human roles in the workplace ex - acerbates fear of automation; likewise, even beneficial engagement with technologies at the workplace and the sense that one ’ s industry is un - dergoing digitalization also heighten this fear. Support for H1 (relating fear to changes in work tasks) and H3 (relating fear to sectoral exposure to technology) highlight an intriguing paradox: rather than alleviating fears, familiarity with technology at work and within the sector appears to heighten concerns about auto - mation. People in jobs with higher occupational task content sensitive to automation and in sectors more saturated with robots are more afraid of automation. This conclusion needs to be tested further, particularly as it does not align with the results of qualitative studies such as Nazareno and Schiff [ 62 ]. Our analysis shows that workers become more aware of the potential of automation when they encounter technology in their workplaces, even if it only complements their tasks. This suggests that the presence of automation, regardless of its function, prompts workers to reflect on its broader implications for job security. As a result, we offer a more nuanced understanding of how different forms of technological change Table 6 Fear of automation: OLS regression analysis.

{"page_content": "influence workers ’ perceptions. To the best of our knowledge, our study is unique in examining the relationship between task substitution, task complementarity, and fear of automation. Third, our research also contributes to theories highlighting the skill- biased and routine-biased character of technological impact on the labor market. The confirmation of H2 (fear of automation is related to job routineness) aligns with the theory that repetitive, routine tasks heighten workers ’ fear of automation, as these tasks are most susceptible to automation [ 30 ]. With regard to skill-biased technological change, we find that more educated individuals fear automation less. Furthermore, our observations align coherently with existing schol - arly literature (e.g., Ref. [ 13, 69 ]), substantiating that individuals occupying more precarious positions in the labor market indeed exhibit elevated levels of automation fear. Younger, those with lower educa - tional attainment, and those receiving lower compensation experience a heightened sense of fear towards automation. While finding support for H5 (regarding the relationship between fear of automation and labor market position) was expected in terms of age, income and education, the lack of significant gender difference was surprising given analyses stating that automation may disproportionately affect women in the labor market [ 54 ]. This suggests the need for further research into gender-related perceptions of automation risk. Last but not least, our research shows that the belief in having less control over one ’ s own life heightens fear of automation, closely align - ing with the findings of Innocenti and Golin [ 13 ]. We have accounted for the possibility that this belief may correlate with an individual ’ s socio - economic status, but it can also be influenced by organizational factors. This is a promising and much-needed research direction, enriching the theoretical conceptualization of fear of automation as shaped by mul - tiple factors. We believe that our study ’ s insights into the determinants of fear of automation can be instrumental for organizational leaders and policy - makers. Given the paradox that increased familiarity with technology seems to heighten, rather than alleviate, automation fears, how should organizations and policymakers address this issue to better support their workforce? It may be argued that, when carefully managed, fear of automation can motivate employees to engage in training and acquire new professional skills. Workers may internalize the need to take action to maintain employability in changing labor markets [ 68 ]. However, as some studies suggest [ 6 ], workers often prefer redistribution and gov - ernment support programs to individually addressing these challenges through training or career changes. Such instrumental manipulation of workers ’ fear of automation may not only be unethical — manifesting as structural violence and deepening workplace inequalities — but could also, in the long term, harm human-centered digital transformation. Fear of automation can shape employee attitudes toward digital trans - formation, potentially leading some to resist the process or, in extreme cases, engage in acts of sabotage, for example when digitalization de - stabilizes standard working time or employment relationships [ 84 ]. Understanding the factors contributing to fear of automation is crucial to better address the psychological and practical challenges posed by the growing integration of technology in the workplace. Furthermore, this understanding can inform sustainable human resource management practices that balance technological advancements with workers ’ well-being and adaptability, fostering a more inclusive digital transition [ 85 ]. In conclusion, we would like to emphasize the importance of, and the need for, future research on perceived control over one ’ s fate in relation to fear of automation, a factor was only peripherally addressed in our study that requires further analysis. The workplace is a central aspect of contemporary life, and its organizational culture can influence percep - tions of reduced control, particularly when intersecting with personal and socioeconomic characteristics. Enhancing employees ’ agency and involvement in decision-making during the implementation of new technologies, thereby their sense of control, could be a key strategy for mitigating the fear of automation. Furthermore, policy measures should focus on enhancing technology awareness and demonstrating its com - plementary role to human labor. It is essential to develop targeted res - killing and upskilling programs for younger, less educated, and lower- income workers to align with labor market demands and industry- specific needs. Additionally, encouraging job redesign to integrate technology as a supportive tool can help transform workplace dynamics and reduce anxiety associated with automation. Incorporating partici - patory design into the deployment of new technologies can also improve workers ’ sense of control and acceptance. Tailoring these strategies to the unique contexts of Austria, Czechia, Germany, Hungary, Poland, and Slovakia will maximize the effectiveness of interventions.

{"page_content": "measures should focus on enhancing technology awareness and demonstrating its com - plementary role to human labor. It is essential to develop targeted res - killing and upskilling programs for younger, less educated, and lower- income workers to align with labor market demands and industry- specific needs. Additionally, encouraging job redesign to integrate technology as a supportive tool can help transform workplace dynamics and reduce anxiety associated with automation. Incorporating partici - patory design into the deployment of new technologies can also improve workers ’ sense of control and acceptance. Tailoring these strategies to the unique contexts of Austria, Czechia, Germany, Hungary, Poland, and Slovakia will maximize the effectiveness of interventions.
